       "Earlier this year, I created a digital assets working group of democratic members to meet with leading regulators, advocates, and other experts on how these novel products and services are reshaping our financial system. This hearing, subsequent hearings on this topic will help this committee consider how to support responsible innovation that protects consumers and investors, safeguards our financial system from systemic risk, promotes financial inclusion, addresses environmental contents, as well as to consider a potential central bank digital currency. We have also held several subcommittee and task force hearings earlier this year to better understand the landscape of this industry. At today’s hearing, which I worked with a ranking member McHenry to organize, I look forward to engaging directly with this panel of cryptocurrency CEOs, whose company’s issue stable coins and provide an exchange to buy and sell digital assets, to understand where they think their products, services, and technologies are heading.</p>\n",

       "Americans are increasingly making financial decisions using digital assets every day. Even some pension funds are beginning to invest in cryptocurrencies on behalf of retirees, despite the track record of volatility of cryptocurrencies as investments. The pandemic has also continued to contribute to working families looking for alternatives to rebuild their nest egg by investing in cryptocurrency. The rapid growth of this industry has also become more visible with celebrity endorsements and ATMs that exchange cash for cryptocurrency. However, several questions remain as to how traditional rules apply and whether regulators have sufficient authority to protect investors and consumers while maintaining market integrity and encouraging innovation. Currently cryptocurrency markets have no overarching or centralized regulatory framework, leaving investments in the digital aspect space vulnerable to fraud, manipulation, and abuse. Some cryptocurrency market exchanges and stable coin issuers have obtained state money transmitter and sale of checks, licenses from multiple states, and at least three cryptocurrency companies have obtained conditional approval for national trust bank charters from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.</p>\n",

At the same time, the promise of digital assets and providing faster payments, instantaneous settlements, and lower transaction fees for remittances or areas that our committee is exploring as more and more people invest in and use cryptocurrencies.

       "Thank you, madam chair. 2021 was the year of the cryptocurrency. More Americans than ever are taking notice of this transformational technology. DeFi, DOWs, NFTs, Web 3, jargon that was really once just used on crypto Twitter, they’re quickly becoming part of the lexicon. Technology and its adoption are moving fast. Entrepreneurs and innovators are building and deploying the next generation of the internet, and firms like the ones before us are the on-ramp for many Americans to participate in the digital asset ecosystem, but this panel’s only a bit of that broad ecosystem. And this is the first time Congress is having a hearing about cryptocurrencies in its fullness. But as with any new and fast growing industry, there are questions that need to be answered.</p>\n",

       "I want to be clear though, this technology is already regulated. Now, the regulations may be clunky, they may not be up to date. I ask my friends, my policy maker friends here on the Hill this question: do you know enough about this technology to have a serious debate? Now, if the answer’s no, then we need to first seek to understand, to build up that understanding of this new technology so we can have a serious debate on how we appropriately respond and update regulations and perhaps laws. But I should be clear, the goal today is to listen, learn, and ask questions. This technology is new and exciting. It promises a new direction for financial economies, services, and products.</p>\n",

       "I further ask this question though, how do we make sure as American policy makers that this cryptocurrency revolution, this technology revolution happens in the US and not overseas? There are a lot of we have to answer, but of course we need reasonable rules of the road. We know that. We don’t need kneejerk reactions by lawmakers to regulate out of fear of the unknown rather than seeking to understand. And that fear of the unknown and the move to regulate before understanding will only stifle America in ingenuity and put us at a competitive disadvantage. Throughout history, we’ve seen examples, countless harmful examples of overregulation around the world by governments. In the late 1800s, England reacted to the rise of cars with laws that required three people to operate vehicles at all times, one to drive, a second to fuel up the vehicle, and a third to stand in front of the car and wave a red flag.</p>\n",

       "Now, Congress should not be dumb enough to raise a red flag around this technology revolution. We should embrace it, we should understand it, and we should be the international leaders in this space. Further example I would tell you is Skype, the video conferencing platform that may still be a little clunky, but was vital during the COVID shutdowns that we just experienced. And it was vital for some of our kids to even go to school, or even have hearings on this massive screen here. Skype was illegal in most of the world when it was launched. There wasn’t a regulatory infrastructure in place that allowed this novel technology, this new technology. And finally, when an invention called the internet began to boom, US lawmakers and regulators struggled to fully grasp the immense possibilities of this innovation out the gate. Now that was the early nineties, and I think we’re in a similar state with Web 3 30 years later, for Congress first to understand before we would seek to legislate. Now, it would be nearly impossible to go a day without using the internet to communicate. We know that. Or move from point A to point B. We know that. Or purchase necessities for our families. We know that. I would argue that the nascent technology we’re discussing today will have just as much impact on our daily lives, perhaps more. And that’s why we must get this right. My fear, however, is that we’ll have a partisan divide here. Well, my fear is that some of my Democrat colleagues have already made up their minds and they have regulatory bills that they’re going to file in order to stifle this innovation or to kill it before it fully grows and blossoms.</p>\n",

Forcing the private sector to navigate unclear public statements and regulation by enforcement is the wrong approach. So is demonizing an entire industry based off the headlines guarded by a few bad actors. Understandably, there are concerns with the use of cryptocurrencies for nefarious activities. Let me address that. You know what else is used for nefarious activities? Cash. So let’s dispel the rumor now that digital asset technology’s a looming threat to our financial system. Instead, we should work to fully understand the opportunities the next generation of the internet could provide to Americans. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses. I look forward to having a deeper understanding as a policymaker about the ramifications for action by Congress before we understand this new technology that is now actually a decade old. So with that, madam chair, thank you for having the hearing. Thank you for working with us on a bipartisan panel.

       "Good morning Chairman Waters, ranking member McHenry, and members of the House Financial Services Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to share my testimony with you today. My name is Jeremy Allaire and I’m the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Circle Internet Financial, a now eight year old company that has operated at the cutting edge of the digital assets market and digital currency technology innovation. Today, we’re at a pivotal moment in the development of the next major infrastructure layer of the internet, extending from an internet of data, content, and communications to an internet of value exchange and economic coordination. In a world where money becomes a core feature of the internet, the United States should be aggressively promoting the use of the dollar as the primary currency of the internet and leverage that as a source of national economic competitiveness. Circle’s mission is to raise global economic prosperity through the frictionless exchange of financial value, creating a world where financial inclusion, responsible financial services innovation, and protecting the integrity of the global financial system are not conflicting objectives.</p>\n",

       "Today I’d like to address some of the key policy issues facing the United States around the rapid growth and use of dollar digital currencies, also known as stablecoins. Circle is the sole issuer of USD Coin or USDC, an innovation that brings the benefits of digital currency: fast, inexpensive, highly secure, global, and interoperable value exchange over the internet, without the downside of extreme volatility that has plagued most cryptocurrencies. USDC is helping to pave the way for digital dollars to be the leading currency of the internet. While stablecoins got started as a dollar settlement layer for digital asset trading markets, their use in everyday payments is expanding rapidly. Just in the past several weeks, Circle has signed on institutional customers who are using these services for small business payments, international remittances, and efficient payments for remote workers.</p>\n",

       "Soon, we believe that dollars on the internet will be as efficient and widely available as text messages and email. As the recent president’s working group report on stablecoins highlighted, not all of these payment instruments are created equal, but by the same token, not all of them are part of an unregulated wild west as has often been portrayed. In our case, we have prioritized building, designing, and guarding the prudential standards for USDC inside of and conforming with prevailing US regulatory standards that apply to leading FinTech and payments firms. This approach has helped USDC to reach over 40 billion in circulation and has powered more than $1 trillion in on-chain transactions.</p>\n",
       "<p>Jeremy Allaire: (<a data-wpel-link=\"exclude\" href=\"https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/FK4Sq9VozH4P5INV5eY8CoFR8T8IV1XBcC-elHVPodGKjdFPoGQhFRcOwBl1KkT2rJ2blSBNC-MIPAj12LvByFVR_gA?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=884.07\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">14:44</a>)<br/>\n",
       "The reserves back in USDC are held in the care, custody, and control of the US regulated banking system. These are strictly held in cash and short duration US government treasuries, and we have consistently reported on the status of these reserves and their sufficiency to meet demands for USDC outstanding with third party out of stations from a leading global accounting firm. With this growth comes in increasing responsibility to foster financial inclusion. To that end, we aim to deploy cash deposits across the country where we will allocate a share of USDC reserves, hopefully accruing to billions of dollars over time to minority depository institutions and community banks as a way of improving their balance sheets, but also ensuring that the future of payments and banking is more inclusive than the past. The president’s working group report on stablecoins has put forward a set of recommendations for establishing national regulatory supervision of firms, such as Circle.</p>\n",

       "We support this effort and believe there can be strong nonpartisan support for the appropriate federal supervision of this highly strategic payments infrastructure. Well prior to the president’s working group report, we announced our plans to pursue a national banking charter from the OCC, and we continue prioritizing active engagement with all of the relevant federal and state banking regulators. There’s much work to do in defining the critical statutory requirements for stablecoins. At the same time, the technology of blockchains and digital assets are not standing still, and whatever the ultimate policy and regulatory outcomes, it is crucial that policy embraces and enables the United States to be global leaders in the development of the internet of value. As the committee works in earnest on these issues, we welcome active engagement and believe this to be one of the most important areas for economic infrastructure and growth in the coming decade.

About a year and a half ago, we started up FTX US, our United States based in servicing operations. A few points on FTX in the broader cryptocurrency industry. The first is that I think that the industry has the potential to improve a lot of people’s lives. There are a lot of ways that this can happen. I think that the payments side of this gets a lot of attention, and rightfully so. Every time that a common consumer goes to a market to purchase goods, they pay multiple percent in fees to intermediaries. And that’s if they’re lucky.</p>\n",

It can get embezzled by various third party scams in the middle. And in general, the global financial ecosystem is not one where sending assets to those who are important to you is easy to do. And this hits the people who are least off the hardest, who have the least access to the financial ecosystem as it exists today. When you look at the number of people who are underbanked or unbanked, both in the United States and globally, it’s indicative of a system that does not work for everyone. And this is a product of the intermediation involved, it’s a product of how the larger institutions have evolved, and it’s a product of payments infrastructure that is difficult and clunky enough to use that it just does not work for most people.</p>\n",

       "Thank you, Chairman Waters and ranking member McHenry and members of the committee. Thank you very much for having me here today to talk about digital assets and the future of finance. The topic is an important one for anyone who cares about American competitiveness in the financial services sector, a financial ecosystem that empowers users over bank CEOs and other powerful central decision makers, and the next iteration of the internet in which individuals are able not only to read information and write content, but also to own a piece of the networks themselves. I am CEO of Bitfury Group, a company that provides a suite of infrastructure products and services that support various aspects of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, an ecosystem many of us today refer to as Web 3, since crypto assets generally represent either the rewards paid to participants for maintaining a particular decentralized network or an app that operates on such a network. Since 2011, Bitfury has designed and produced eight successive generations of ASIC chips and related equipment for conducting transaction validation activity on the Bitcoin blockchain, a process known informally as Bitcoin mining.</p>\n",

       "Along the way, Bitfury developed a series of adjacent businesses to make crypto assets safe, sustainable, and useful. Our various businesses include Liquid Stack, one of the world’s largest immersion cooling systems, focused on reducing the energy used in Bitcoin mining and other high performance data centers by as much as 90%, Crystal, a blockchain analytics company that provides transaction monitoring and related compliance tools to more than 150 law enforcement agencies, crypto exchanges, and financial services companies in Europe, Asia and North America, Axelera, a producer of cutting edge artificial intelligence ASIC chips, and others. I believe the committee’s topic today requires an understanding of three important threshold issues. First, a national policy agenda that takes crypto compliance seriously should assess whether it makes more sense to continue to keep crypto activities largely out of the regulated financial system or whether it makes more sense to bring them inside the system precisely so that they can be supervised and operated with appropriate levels of risk management.</p>\n",

       "For example, is it consistent to take the position that only banks should be allowed to issue stablecoins, but then fail to grant bank charters to the largest issuers of stablecoins? That would, after all, bring stablecoin activity within the ambit of an existing national bank supervision system with which we’re all familiar. Or does it make sense to bring enforcement actions challenging certain crypto assets as unregistered securities, but then fail to allow those assets to be registered and trade on a national securities exchange subject to supervision by FINRA and the SCC? Second, Americans deserve to know what our national policy is for a decentralized Web 3 powered by crypto assets. Treating crypto as a single unitary activity whose main feature is a need for financial regulation would be like treating the original internet in the 1990s as primarily a tax policy issue. We didn’t do that then.</p>\n",

       "What we had in the 1990s with respect to Web 1 that we lack today with respect to crypto is a comprehensive national policy predicated first on the notion of do no harm to the emerging network. Today, instead of focusing only on micro questions, such as whether a particular token is a security or whether a particular exchange traded fund may be offered, it would be worthwhile for the elected branches of government to grapple with the bigger questions, such as do we believe a user controlled decentralized internet is better than an internet largely controlled by five big companies? Do we believe that the financial services sector is any less subject to network effects than information and commerce were in earlier iterations of the internet? Do we trust big banks more or open source software more as a tool for maintaining ledges of account and allocating credit and capital?</p>\n",

       "Can we recognize the difference between crypto projects failing for lack of demand, just as many publicly traded companies fail, and the difference between individual crypto projects actually being scams unworthy of being presented to the fair, but sometimes harsh judgment of markets? Third, crypto policy should take into account not only any new risks introduced into the system, but also the risk in the present system that are solved by decentralization. Having issued almost a billion dollars in civil money penalties against banks and bank executives during my tenure leading the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, it is clear to me that the present financial system has plenty of examples of risks and costs and safety and soundness problems that are being addressed in the current system. Shouldn’t we take seriously the possibility that algorithms and open source software that take a measure of human error, greed, negligence, fraud, and bias out of the system might actually make the system better on net, even if there are some new risks being presented that need to be understood and regulated?</p>\n",

       "Apart from those three overarching considerations, I’d like to very quickly make two points specific to my current perspective on the crypto economy. One relates to the effect of US crypto regulation on American competitiveness in both the technology and capital market sectors. There are a number of examples of US regulatory decisions that have driven legitimate activity offshore in ways that harm US investors, innovators, and workers. Can anyone explain, for example, why Fidelity Investments, one of America’s best known investment advisors, had to go to Canada to offer a Bitcoin ETF, or why physically settled crypto ETFs are safe and legal in Germany, Brazil, Singapore, and elsewhere, but somehow not in the United States?</p>\n",

Paxos is a regulated financial institution and blockchain infrastructure platform. Paxos’ customers include Bank of America, PayPal, MasterCard, Interactive Brokers, Credit Suite, and many others. We help financial institutions provide their clients with reliable, regulated access to digital assets. Paxos also offers a uniquely structured and regulated stablecoin, the Pax dollar. Each Pax dollar is fully backed by one US dollar. As a result, it is not volatile like other types of digital assets. However, it retains the same properties that make digital assets so appealing. It can be transferred nearly instantly overnight and on weekends, and it is programmable, secure, and traceable.</p>\n",

       "Digital assets and blockchain technologies can create a more efficient, secure, and innovative financial system, and a more exclusive and equitable global economy.

The current system is expensive and slow. International and even domestic money transfers can take days. At any given time, there are trillions of dollars worth of capital held up in transactions that have not yet settled. Digital assets are vastly more accessible. Anyone with a smartphone can download a wallet app to send and receive assets. No bank account is required.</p>\n",

Digital assets can also reduce bias in finance. At its heart, blockchain is just a math equation. It is agnostic to a user’s race, gender, nationality, or income. And blockchain permanently and publicly records transactions, reducing errors, fraud, and systemic risk. A blockchain based financial architecture could settle trades on the same day, thus mitigating counterparty risk and eliminating the need for costly central clearinghouse.

Paxos became the first regulated trust for digital assets in the country, when it was approved by the New York state department of financial services in 2015. We adhere to the same anti money laundering and know your customer rules as banks. We are subject to regular examinations of our operations, procedures and capital levels. Our products are also regulated. Of the world’s three regulated dollar backed stablecoins, two are issued by Paxos.

Regulation must ensure that customer assets are held segregated from the company’s balance sheet. For stablecoins, independent auditors should regularly attest that assets back in the token are always held in reserve.

I took this role and joined the blockchain more than two and a half years ago. Prior to that, I was the chief operating officer of the Mozilla corporation, where I spent a lot of my time advocating, among other things, openness and interoperability in web technologies. It’s those same policy priorities that drew me to blockchain. An industry that I believe can learn from past mistakes made in other areas of web development. Stellar is an open, permissionless, decentralized network, that is optimized for payments. There is no single entity, including SDF, that controls the code base of the network or its growth. You don’t need permission to use this technology, just like the underpinnings of the internet, it is ready and available for use to anyone.</p>\n",

       "Importantly, and especially in the context of this hearing, Stellar was designed for asset issuance, making it possible to create, send and trade digital assets backed by nearly any form of value. And also is designed with compliance tools built in to help those asset issuers meet their own compliance obligations. The Stellar platform is a pioneer of tokenization, optimized for Fiat backed asset issuance before stablecoin was even in a word. And over the last few years, an ecosystem of businesses and users have built use cases around Stellar based stablecoins due to their incredible utility to solve many of the problems we see in today’s payment landscape. Despite the headlines, what’s happening in the world with blockchain, with cryptocurrency and stablecoins is not just lending, trading and borrowing. Other use cases are active and focused on solving real world challenges using the technology.</p>\n",

MoneyGram’s network integrates with the Stellar blockchain to able cash funding of digital accounts and payout in different currencies of the consumer’s choice, using stablecoins. It’s using Circle’s USDC coin. In real terms, consumers will be able to send value in the stablecoin and easily convert to local Fiat currency for instant pickup for thousands of participating MoneyGram locations globally. This is in pilot phase right now in the US, and is expected to be widely available in 2022. Another example, Leaf Global FinTech has built the solution for refugees and cross-border goods traders who are vulnerable to theft while carrying across borders.

This use case is live and operational today. The last use case I’d like to touch on is one that is in development. Tala is best known for its mobile lending app, which enables its customers to apply for a loan and receive an instant decision, regardless of their credit history. Tala is now working to expand their offering by using Stellar assets and stablecoins, to help their current customers with credit, by allowing borrowing, spending, saving, investing, and sending and receiving. There are many more valuable use cases in the Stellar ecosystem that I would love to be able to share with you today. But I would just briefly like to mention that in a recent report from the G20 and IFC, there were five Stellar ecosystem companies named for their innovative solutions in digital finance, supporting MSMEs. Use cases like these are in varying states of maturity, but their current and potential value is undeniable.</p>\n",

And by extension, that means stablecoin are essential on delivering on financial inclusion. So, that brings me to the PWG report on stablecoins. The PWG report raises legitimate risks, but it’s recommended solutions that go too far. Specifically to limit stablecoin issuance to insured depository institutions is not narrowly tailored to the actual risk of stablecoin arrangements for the simple reason that although there are outliers, most stablecoins, unlike bank deposits, are fully reserved. Instead, we advocate for a reg approach that it focuses more on stablecoin reserves by requiring stablecoin arrangements be fully reserved by appropriate assets, requiring reserves to be held as insured depository institutions, creating clear standards for regular audit and public disclosure of stablecoin reserves and key contractual terms regarding redemption, and by making it clear that payment stablecoins are not securities.</p>\n",

In Nigeria, stablecoins and blockchain technology were eliminating costly foreign exchange and transaction fees and slow processing times until the Central Bank of Nigeria abruptly ended that business model.

       "Much like the adoption curve of the internet in the 1990s, we are seeing dramatic advancements in crypto participation. There are more than 220 million crypto holders globally.

Total crypto market capitalization at the end of the third quarter was over $2 trillion, up from 800 billion, as of the end of 2020 Coinbase’s platform is powering the crypto economy, a new financial system for the internet age, which we believe is a critical infrastructure layer to web 3.0. Technologies like non-fungible tokens, which we call NFTs, and decentralized application platforms will lead the away to web 3.0, which will revolutionize the internet, much like the industry was revolutionized when it went from static content to the dynamic engagement content we have today. We believe sound regulation is central to fueling crypto innovation and adoption. That is why we introduced our Digital Asset Policy Proposal, which we refer to as dApp. The dApp Assessed the challenges of the existing regulatory framework and proposed a four pillar solution. First, we believe the government should recognize digital assets under a new comprehensive framework that recognizes the unique technological innovations underpinning digital assets. Second, the responsibility for this new framework should be assigned to a single federal regulator. This regulator would be charged with establishing a registration process for intermediaries, which we refer to as marketplaces for digital assets. Third, this new framework should have three goals to ensure holders of digital assets are empowered and protected. A, we believe in enhanced transparency through robust and appropriate disclosure requirements. B, we want to protect against fraud and market manipulation. And C, we want to promote efficiency and strengthen our market resiliency. Our fourth and final pillar is to ensure that regulatory solutions promote interoperability and fair competition.</p>\n",

       "Thank you very much. I now recognize myself for five minutes for questions. Mr. Cascarilla, I’m a bit concerned about company, Paxo’s partnership with Facebook, which is now calling itself Meta. As you know, Facebook has attempted several times to enter the cryptocurrency market starting in 2019, they founded the Libra Association, based in Switzerland, with the goal of creating a stablecoin, but suspended its activities after this committee held hearings. And I, along with other members, and US regulators, raised significant concerns leading to a number of Libra association members pulling out. Now in partnership with Paxos and Coinbase, Facebook has launched a pilot project with this digital wallet, Novi, for a limited number of individuals in the United States and Guatemala to send and receive money using your stablecoin known as USDP, or Pax Dollar. As you know, one of the recommendations in the recent president’s working group report focuses on mitigating systemic risk posed by stablecoins, as well as concentration of economic power concerns.</p>\n",

       "The report among other things recommends legislation that stablecoin users must comply with activity restrictions that limit affiliation with commercial entities, similar to restrictions most banks face to promote the separation of banking and commerce. While your partnership with Facebook is reportedly a pilot, limited to a number of users in Guatemala and the United States, what is stopping Facebook from the future allowing its nearly 3 billion, monthly active users to make payments and save funds with the Pax Dollar, or other previously issued stablecoin through a Novi wallet? If this were allowed at such a scale, how not undermine the US dollar and the world’s reserve currency? Mr. Cascarilla, are you still muted? Can you hear me?</p>\n",

       "There we go. Sorry about that. Thank you for the question, Chairwoman. So, I think it’s important to note in the case of Novi, that they are a customer Paxos just like any other customer of Paxos. We have an open product, they could use that product in the open market, they decided to come to Paxos. And I think they did that because we have the most regulated stablecoin product. And I think that was an important decision for them, that they wanted to use a well regulated product. And I think another important point here is, Novi is our customer, that’s a subsidiary of Facebook Meta. But Novi itself is a regulated money services business.</p>\n",

       "They are regulated to operate in almost all states in the United States and we have done extensive due diligence on their controls and the regulatory oversight that they have.

And so, in terms of the Novi usage of our product, it’s just like anybody else, just like if they had a bank account, which they do, and they were using.

We’re trying to level set here for policymakers. So, originally the internet was a read-only format, in essence, we’re consuming information. And then there’s additional layers that we place on. It became much more interactive. But counterintuitively, much more interactive, but much more centralized, in web 1.0 and web 2.0. What we’re hearing now is web 3.0. Policy makers need to understand the nature of web 3.0. This is a hearing about a component of web 3.0. Now, along those lines, what are the characteristics that defined web 1.0 and web 2.0?</p>\n",

       "Mr. McHenry, thank you very much for that question. I think that’s critical to understanding what we’re all trying to build here. So, the characteristic of web 1.0, if people remember their original AOL account, was an ability to look in a curated walled garden at a set of content that was not interactive, but was presented to you on AOL the way that TIME magazine used to show you the articles they wanted you to see inside of their magazine, just you could see it on a screen. The innovation of web 2.0 was that suddenly you could not only read content, but you could also write content. This is when the blogosphere became a big thing. People remember this from the late 90’s, the early 2000’s. The reason for the centralization of the internet of course, was that all of that activity was being monetized by a very small number of companies.</p>\n",

So, when you hear people talk about, for example, layer-1 tokens, what they mean is, this is your reward for providing the ledger maintenance services, the computing power to the network, that on web 1.0 and two was done by Google, right? So, now people in my hometown of Pueblo, Colorado can actually own the Ethereum network, but they can’t own the internet, that’s owned by Google and a few other companies.

So, if I’m an owner of Bitcoin, let’s say that I’m a miner of Bitcoin, somebody who actually creates Bitcoin. The Bitcoin is the reward I receive for doing the work to keep the network operational. And that allows me to own a piece of the Bitcoin blockchain. Or take Ethereum, which is easier to understand, the Ether token represents an ownership stake in the network.

The difference being here, you can vote on what happens in the future of a proof-of-stake network, for example, you can get rewarded through a proof-of-work token for maintaining a ledger on something like Bitcoin, but the real message here is that what happens on the decentralized internet is decided by the investors, versus what happens on the main internet is decided by Twitter, Facebook, Google, and a small number of other companies.</p>\n",

We call one the hot wallet and we call one cold storage and less than 2% of our assets are held in a hot wallet, which is subject of a cyber attack. Specifically, the incident you mentioned was not a hack of the Coinbase systems, but in that event where customers did lose funds due to other losses, we did reimburse customers for that event.

So it’s very simple in terms of how it can get from one point to another. And it does so very, very quickly. The importance of that is it actually can cross borders much more simply than anything else that’s out there today. So the value of blockchain is the ability to send from the United States, for example, and send to another country without having to reconcile with all the different software and intermediaries that exist today. So it eliminates intermediaries. It creates less friction in the marketplace, and it allows users who don’t have bank accounts today, or who choose not to get bank accounts or have been de-risked by banks from being able to, to be able to access this technology very cleanly because they can do so with a wallet.</p>\n",

And so, we’re seeing all types of things. We’ve had early conversations with real estate developers to get broader global liquidity, more liquid markets for tokens. We’ve seen a lot of innovation in the payment space and a lot of innovation in NFTs with digital art. But this is just the tip.

       "Sure. Well, Congressman Lucas, thank you so much. And it’s nice to see you again as well. One of the historical differences between banks and stable coin issuers is that banks in this country historically have been engaged in multiple different kinds of financial intermediation and risk taking functions. Banks typically engage in three different things, deposit taking, lending, and payments. The core feature of stable coins is they’re a new payments technology and payments are one of the core things that banks do, right? So banks historically innovated in payments by first having check clearing, then later having travelers checks, then later being prepaid cards and things like that.</p>\n",

       "Stable coin is just the faster, most modern way of transmitting those values. Stable coin issuers, of course, don’t present all of the risks that banking presents. They don’t typically engage in lending or anything else. And this is one of the reasons why at the OCC, we look very carefully at the possibility that payment companies like American Express in a different generation, circle today might possibly qualify for bank charters. They’re engaged in a core banking function, but not in the other banking functions. It’s to my point earlier that sometimes crypto is reducing risk, not increasing risk.</p>\n",

       "I think that there’s a really big opportunity with respect to blockchain. I think when you mentioned before about tokenized assets, there already are tokenized interest in real estate that exist on Stellar, for example, or in fractionalized interest in US stock. So there’s opportunity for growth there. With respect to what we have with blockchain and what can be accessible, that banks already have available out there, but when they de-risk populations and they de-risk individuals out of the banking infrastructure, they can actually access accounts, hold assets, hold their assets into a digital framework, and then do a lot of the same things that you can do at banking institutions. But these individuals couldn’t get access to it before. So I think blockchain create that financial inclusion that we’re all talking about and that we all want to get to. And it does show I think with, as Ms. Haas indicated with the different layers, the infrastructure layer and the application layers, there’s so much creativity that’s happening now. So I think we have a long road ahead of us with respect to this technology.</p>\n",

Bitcoin, for example, lost half of this value over two days in March. And it rebounded of course later on, but there are many problems leading up to the global financial crisis that seem to be manifesting themselves in the market currently. Easy credit, via margin investing, lack of transparency, the lack of transparency that I’d like to see, and adequate financial disclosure is not readily available. With the explosive growth in cryptocurrencies, at what point should we become concerned about the possibility of a bubble? At what point should we become concerned about the possibility of a bubble?

       "Well, thank you, Congressman Green. It’s terrific to see you again. And I always find your questions extremely perceptive. What I would say about that question is a lot of the price volatility of cryptocurrency has to do with the early stage of the market and the thinly traded nature of the asset compared to, for example, US real estate, global equities, or anything like that. I think the message I’d land with this committee in response to your question, however, is some of the things that make US equity and debt markets more stable and less volatile have to do with the fact that there’s a lot more price discovery in those areas. And what I mean by that is in the US, we have regulated equity mutual funds. We have derivatives products and futures products that allow the free trading on a 24/7 basis that provides the market with forecasts of what’s happening in the ecosystem.</p>\n",

       "In the world of crypto, the US hasn’t responded by developing those tools for price discovery yet. And so the result in a relatively new, relatively thinly traded market is that one person unwinding their position can have a massive effect on the price. The last point I would just make very quickly is something like 80% of Bitcoin holders have never sold a Bitcoin. And so when you hear about a day when there was a giant price drop in Bitcoin, often it turns out that there was one or two large traders who were unwinding a leveraged position, and the vast majority of holders have enough confidence in it that they’ve literally never sold a unit of it. So I would argue we need more liquidity and more price discovery to a tamp down volatility, not less.</p>\n",

So they understand you look at user experience, you look at UX design, all of these things are really, really important. And as we saw in the early days of the web, it happened, it came together. We became better at educating the audience about what’s available and what’s out there. The nice thing about blockchain is you have immutability, you have records that are out there that can’t be changed. This information is already leveraged by chain analysis, for example, in Elliptic, to demonstrate the different things that are happening on chain.

The question I would ask, and I don’t know which one of you to ask this. So I would just say we’re always interested in a traditional financial model of identifying risk. What is a risk?

One in onboarding, as we’ve talked about, we do KYC, but also in when we onboard our assets. So we offer, as I mentioned, over 100 assets for trading on our platform. We have a robust assessment of each of those assets. We’re looking at it for legal risks. Do we think it has the contours of a federal security? We do not list securities on our platform. Two, we’re looking at it for compliance reasons. Is this a scam? Are there real people behind those? Behind them on the OFAC list, we don’t want to list that token. So we’re doing a full compliance review of the founders of the coin, the developers on the project. And then we’re looking at it from a security risk.</p>\n",

Two, through our market rules, we do have traditional exchange rules for looking for spoofing, for wash trading, for all sorts of market manipulation on our platform that we have third party tools, as well as employees that came from former regulators or from traditional financial services that do 24/7 monitoring much like Mr. Bankman-Fried responded to the risk models. We do compliance monitoring on a 24/7 basis. We also then monitor the blockchains. One of the wonderful things about this technology is the transparency. And so we can look for transaction activity, look for patterns on the blockchain. And then we partner with law enforcement.

As you may be aware, communities of color often rely on minority depository institutions or community development financial institutions to safely do business and get access to crucial banking needs. And given an important role as well as the challenges that they face, I’ve been a long advocate for robust partnerships whereby MDIs and CDFIs can leverage new technologies to better serve their communities, as well as deploy Circle actually for using and exploring such partnerships and creating an initiative to deploy and share USD coin reserves into these MDIs and CDFIs, enhancing financial inclusion. So my question really to you is can you provide us a status update on where Circle is in implementing this program and what sorts of systems will be developed to ensure the long term success of the program?</p>\n",

       "Thank you, Congressman Meeks. I appreciate the question very much. For those on the committee that are not familiar, we recently announced a new broad based company initiative called Circle Impact. It includes several key initiatives. First and foremost, something I did reference in my testimony as well is an initiative to take what we hope will be billions of dollars of the deposits that are held behind USDC and actually place those with minority deposits institutions and community banks throughout the United States. I think one thing that’s important to understand is that unlike a bank that wants to maybe hoard its deposits for its own lending business. As a full reserve model, we’re not in the business of lending. And so it’s a tremendous opportunity for us to work closely with banking institutions that could benefit from strengthened balance sheets, that could benefit from what that in turn can do to open up credit and lending and other opportunities in these underserved communities.</p>\n",

We are also looking to coordinate with federal banking regulators who have their own initiatives that are focused on supporting MDIs and community banks. And we view this as a really critical and strategic part of what we can do to foster a more inclusive financial system. Final comment is simply that we believe that the technology of digital currency, the frictionlessness, the way in which individuals with mobile devices can actively participate. And not just domestically, but interacting with family members around the world and safely exchanging value, that these can also bring significant benefits to these communities. And we will certainly keep the committee up to date on progress with this initiative.</p>\n",

       "Well, Mr. Luetkemeyer, it’s terrific to see you again. And I’d give you a couple of thoughts on that important written question. One is if we start with Stablecoins, before we talk about other crypto assets, I’ve said for a long time that the secular reduction in dollar holdings as a percentage of global central bank holdings is alarming. And this has been going on for more than 10 years at this point. So dollars is a share of the European Central Bank, the Japanese Central Bank, et cetera, has shrunk from 80 plus percent to more like 60 plus percent in a short amount of time. What that tells me is that in the future with the rise of China and other major economies, the US dollar can’t take its primacy for granted. And we need to start thinking about competing on utility, on features, not just based on a post World War II monetary system that we could take for granted for the last two generations.</p>\n",

       "And that’s one of the reasons that I’ve been such a supporter of internet enabled dollars, which allow us to compete on features not only on history, I think that’s really critically important. The second thing I would tell you, as we enter year 11 or 12 of a highly inflationary environment, after all, we’ve been printing enormous numbers of new dollars since the financial crisis, there will come a time gradually then suddenly when the attractiveness of the dollar relative to other currencies could change. One of the benefits of the crypto economy is that it creates some counter incentives on the part of the Fed to do that kind of policy because people will flee to other kinds of assets. And that sort of market competition is something that I think will ultimately shore up our monetary policy and keep the dollar where it rightfully ought to be, which is as the dominant reserve currency it’s been for all of our lives.</p>\n",

Bitcoins succeeded, because there are literally millions of participants in the node network.

Obviously this is going to depend on the exact details of what comes and it’s important that if and when that comes, that Blockchain security algorithms are resistant to that. On the same front, I think it has the potential to create basically new cryptographic algorithms that are faster, that are more secure and that are more efficient from a number of different perspectives.

       "Well, I really appreciate that question. That is the most important issue in the short term for the industry. And so let me just pick up where Mrs. Wagner left off. If the question is, is the current test clear, it’s clear in the sense that we know what it is. It’s not clear in that it’s a four factor balancing test. So I often think about what, the US trucking industry would be like, if the truckers didn’t know that the speed limit was 75 miles an hour, they just had a four factor test of general safety having to do with how much sleep they got the night before, the overall size of their payload and other factors. People need to know what the speed limit is.</p>\n",

We would either give them a nonobjection or we would not give them a nonobjection and it was very clear whether they would be allowed to access that. What happens in the United States is you have a new crypto project and you walk into the SEC and you describe it in great detail, and you ask for guidance and they say, “We can’t tell you, and you list it at your own peril.” So whether this comes from legislation that defines what is a security and what isn’t a security, or whether it comes from Congress in the form of legislative discretion to an agency to say, what is a security, I would argue that a four factor balancing test is no better here than it is as truckers drive down the highway, guessing what safe is.</p>\n",

The best test that is out there is a test that several of us on this panel actually helped to develop about three years ago, as part of an industry organization called the Crypto Rating Council. When I came to see several of you several years ago, in connection with the Crypto Rating Council, the way I described it to you was it’s sort of like motion picture ratings for crypto. We don’t know authoritatively what’s a security and what isn’t, because no authority will tell us. But what we can do at least is we can tell you the difference between an R rated asset and a PG rated asset, and people can make their risk tolerance judgements. So the way that process works is it’s an objective quantitatively based process that asks several dozen questions about the asset across each of the dimensions of the Howey Test.

       "Thank you, Congressman Barr, I’m happy too. I think the first difference is that Stablecoins are operational and growing in the market today and they’re built on an open internet technology model. So when we think about all of the things that we’ve seen built on the open internet on these open protocols and networks, whether it’s ubiquitous information exchange, communications, interaction around the world, that same open internet model is the foundation for Stablecoins and so I think that’s a fundamental difference. A CBDC, which is a concept right now, it’s not operational would very likely be a very closed loop technology that’s tightly administered and run by the government and would unlikely be accessible in the same way that these open networks are accessible. And so I think that’s a critical difference, but I would come back to the most important, which is that most payment system innovations in the world have been driven by the private sector and I think what’s taking place today with digital currency is no different-</p>\n",

       "I think so, yes. I mean, coming back to this and I’ll try and make this point concisely. The United States and the US dollar is winning the digital currency space race today. Dollar Stablecoins are doing trillions of dollars of transactions, the experimental beta of a Chinese yuan, which is government controlled, and China has done $10 billion of transactions. So the United States is winning. This has potential to grow at a very significant speed around the world and benefit the US dollar and benefit American businesses and households. And so I think that’s one really, really critical thing to understand and I think the primacy of this infrastructure and the development of this infrastructure, it is a strategic national security and national economic priority for the United States.

These things are all great, but it’s interesting that most of the people that I know that have invested in cryptocurrencies, not because of that, it’s because they think they can get rich quick.

I would agree with the fact that there are passer buys and then there are people who are actively building and who are very close to the technical innovation and I think like investments in technology companies, or in other businesses that we see in the stock market, you have people who are investing, because they think it’s a business or a product that might go up, they may not understand the details of a given pharmaceutical company’s science, but they believe that perhaps it’s an area of innovation and they want to invest in it.

       "But more importantly, coming back to the comment about the dollar. I think there is this growth in digital assets as a new kind of asset class. And I think what’s important to note is understanding those in contrast to Fiat currencies, many of the digital assets. In fact, I think the overwhelming majority of the digital assets are commodities that are, have utility that are used to power, some kind of technology network or protocol, more thought of like an oil or gas than a Fiat currency. So they exhibit those properties and I don’t think those will ever rival the dollar.

       "Sir, I’m going to reclaim my time just for a second, because one of the things that I see is that we have the digital dollar already. I mean, the digital dollar can do all the things that you guys were talking about today with the exception that it is a Fiat currency, that wouldn’t be as easily manipulated by some nefarious group, because it would be controlled by the Fed and the United States of America. I mean, I do have great apprehension that you have these cryptocurrencies that are used by drug traffickers are used by people trafficking other human beings, and there’s no good way to control it. So I’m all for digital currency, but why not the dollar? Why can’t the dollar be the digital currency? Why can’t we once again, dominate in that 60, 80%, but maybe even higher with a digital dollar? That to me makes much more sense and it’s much more protected and people won’t have the risk, but anyway, I yield back my time, but I did find its very interesting discussion. Thank you.</p>\n",

And when I’m trying to wrap my head around a new topic like cryptocurrencies, I try to relate it back to something I understand like baseball or business. Now some of you may know this, but modern day baseball can really be attributed to Babe Ruth. He brought in the live ball era of the time and introduced power to the baseball diamond. And before this teams would play small ball, that was very conservative where teams would literally play for one, run a game. The entire objective was simply to get the ball in play so they could try to steal their way around the bass pass. And there was nothing wrong with this old way of playing.</p>\n",

       "But when the White Sox won the world series in 1906, the entire team had a total of six home runs all year. But Babe Ruth came along, Babe Ruth came along and totally changed everything in 1920, he set the American league record of home runs with 54 to put that into perspective how fantastic this feet was at the time the previous mark that had been set was by Socks Seybold in 1902 with just 16, this introduced an entire generation of new baseball fans and for the first time ever, the New York Yankees over 1 million fans came to see them in a single season. Now with that being said, many of you are becoming the Babe Ruth in the financial services space. You’re introducing a Blockchain technology to the financial services industry and working to upend the tradition and the traditional way of doing business.</p>\n",

Unfortunately, it would only take a few misguided curve balls, we’ll say, from Washington to undo some of the progress you’ve all put into this motion. So my first question to you, Mr. Brooks, can you talk about some of the negative consequences that could happen if we take a heavy handed approach to regulating this developing technology?</p>\n",

       "Well, Mr. Williams, as a long suffering Dodgers fan, I share a lot of the things you’re talking about. And I think the era you’re talking about was an era when baseball went from focusing on not losing to an era where it focused on winning. And winning and not losing or not the same thing. So I come back to Mr. Vargas’s question a second ago, which I think is the right way to answer your question. Mr. Vargas asked the question of people have the potential to lose a lot of money, these things are volatile, they’re risky, how do we protect them from those kinds of issues? There are two ways of answering that. One is to prevent as many people as possible from accessing this amazing technology. For example, the way the current legal regime works is certain kinds of assets can only be purchased by accredited investors, meaning rich people.</p>\n",

       "So the only people who can get rich on this are people who are already rich. That’d be one way of protecting people from losing money is to make sure that only the richest can access it another way of addressing it would be to make it safer. The way that we made equities safer 40 years ago. We created mutual funds, diversification, sector funds, and other things that make it easier for regular Americans from places like my hometown in Colorado to buy equities, without having to be stock experts. Strangely in the US, we’ve refused to do that out so far, so we don’t allow crypto mutual funds. We don’t allow people to diversify the way that they do in Canada, Germany, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates in a series of other regulated economies around the world. So I would argue the way to win is to bring more people into the system more safely, not to keep them out at their own peril.</p>\n",

The SEC and the CFTC are the primary federal regulators and our states also have strict regulations that all of you must be abiding by.

Do they have sufficient reserve assets behind them? What are the redemption rules? Is there transparency around permission Blockchains?

The first thing that I’ll say is in cryptocurrencies, in digital assets, as like essentially every other financial asset in the world, more volume trades through futures contracts than through the spot asset.

Again, you’ve heard me say it before this morning, but you have on this panel, a big stablecoin issuer who has applied for a bank charter. Doesn’t look like they’re going to get it.

First, regarding controlled anonymity for a prevention of criminal activities. And it seems to me that if we wish to prevent crypto assets from being used, for example, for ransomware or other criminal payments, that there is no logical alternative to having all crypto transactions associated with a legally traceable identity, some one who can be extradited if they do something criminal. And which these can be pseudonymous to market participants and to the public, but then must be capable of being de-anonymized pursuant to the action of a court in a trusted jurisdiction. Do any of you disagree with that conclusion that this is a necessary condition for prevent, for example, ransomware? So let the record show that they no one raised objection to that statement.</p>\n",

       "So I think that’s very significant. So we have to start planning for a system, where in a court, in a suitable jurisdiction can actually de-anonymize any legitimate crypto asset. Okay. And now that is relevant to crypto assets such as stable coins or CBCs that have stable valuations, but still could be used for criminal activities. But for crypto assets which are speculatively traded, then we also have an additional worry, which is abusive trading practices. In that case, we need to know not only the beneficial owner behind a trade, but there has to be a uniquely identified beneficial owner. There has to be a regulator that can see, “Oh, this is a wash trade, because even though they look like separate pseudonymous IDs, they are in fact the same person.” And so that, historically, in trading that has required to have a regulator that can see the true beneficial owners. We spent a decade trying to get the beneficial owner onto the consolidated audit trail, which probably you’re aware of. So do you think that is also a logically necessary condition to prevent wash trades and similar abuses? Yeah. Mr. Bankman-Fried</p>\n",

We’re responsive to governmental inquiries about that. We’re overseen by the CFTC on that with FTX US derivatives. I also think that this is a powerful argument in favor of having harmonized regulatory and market frameworks, in particular, between different asset classes. Where if you end up with a different regulatory framework for the market’s regulation of Bitcoin, Bitcoin derivatives, stable coin, stable coin derivatives, Ethereum, Ethereum derivatives, and other assets, you end up making it not just riskier and harder and more annoying for the user to access and more overhead for the industry, but you make it hard to have consistent regulatory oversight of a fractured regime.</p>\n",

Now, in terms of tax payments. It seems to me that if there was simply the requirement for any digitally traded asset to be associated with pseudonymized, basically, a tax ID that you have an API provided by the government that says, “Give me a pseudonymous tax ID,” and that be put publicly on the blockchain, and that that blockchain be listed with the tax authorities, that then that tax authorities could just run a piece of software and calculate how much tax everyone owed.

FTX US offers crypto commodity derivatives products, such as futures and options contracts. To provide these products in the United States is my understanding that FTX US has obtained at least four licenses from the CFTC, which you listed in your testimony.</p>\n",

I go back and I think about my 30 years I spent in the IT field, had the government got in the way of the internet, we would still be using dial-up today to do a lot of what we’re doing. So I think we have to proceed very cautiously. One thing I’ve learned in the 30 years in the IT sector, especially 10 years that I spent intelligence realm in the Air force, is the most important aspect from an IT perspective is data security, cybersecurity. It’s something we have to be focused on all the time. In fact, in my business, 20 years in the private sector, that was the number one issue for most of my customers.</p>\n",

       "Well, Mr. Loudermilk is good to see you, and I appreciate the question. The simplest answer, as I said earlier today, is that blockchains are as much about transparency. They are about security. So one of the biggest problems, when you think about the biggest cyberhacks we’ve ever had in the United States, is how long it took for us to figure out that they occurred. The case of Target, the case of Equifax, some of these things, we found out days and weeks later by accident that they occurred.</p>\n",

       "And if you think about the Equifax hack, in particular, initially, we thought it was a small problem. Weeks later, we learned it was a medium size problem. And only months later, did we learn it was a gigantic problem that involved all of our data, because there was no transparency.</p>\n",

       "The thing about blockchains is every single block as it is validated is publicly visible to the network. The other thing about blockchain is it’s based on a consensus mechanism. So before you can have a change to the ledger, you have to have a significant majority of all of the validators agree that that’s the correct change. And so unlike normal networks where one bad guy can defeat the entire system, here you have to have thousands of computers agreeing at the same time that the change can be made. And even then, everyone sees it. That hiding in plain side aspect is the safest thing about blockchain, that’s why it’s so critical to our security infrastructure.</p>\n",

I think that there are businesses that transact on the network, the interoperability with the traditional financial system is remarkable, you can actually take money from a bank account, put it into digital asset, transfer that value to wherever it’s being sent, and then it can convert right back into a bank account. The fact that you have such complete interoperability with the existing financial infrastructure, should give us all the ability to take excitement about elevating that technology to the right level, so that we continue to innovate there.</p>\n",

One of the ways that bad actors or rogue states could try to fool exchanges is by using technology like VPN that spoof IP addresses, fooling others into thinking that they’re in a different location. So let’s go with Mr. Brooks on this one. Can you speak to the importance of moving away from IP addresses to verified location?

       "Well, a couple of quick answers. So on the compliance side, I think the use of VPNs to avoid geolocation and to avoid sort of geofencing is something that three years ago was effective and useful. And the industry has developed lots of technologies that make that much, much harder today. So some of these decentralized tools, several of the companies have been mentioned already Chainalysis, Elliptic, and some others, have an ability to actually trace IP addresses based on probabilistic sort of network information.</p>\n",

       "So it’s not just that that IP address might have been issued by an ISP in a given jurisdiction, it’s also that that IP address is associated with lots of other transactions that could only be Cuba or could only be Libya or whatever.

However, there’s some subtlety in this topic and I think it’s important for the committee to consider it. A full reserve digital currency model such as USDC, where a 100% of the assets are fully in high quality liquid assets such as cash and short duration US treasuries, is not the same as a bank deposit where the bank is in turn taking the deposit and rehypothecating it and lending it.

So I think ultimately coming back to your question, I think that statutes in the United States should support stablecoin issuers that are operating at a state level, at a federal level and support money services businesses as well as banks, being active participants in the stablecoin ecosystem. And I think it’s important that the barrier to entry in the stablecoin space not be so high, that startups that are innovating as money services businesses can’t participate in this innovation.</p>\n",

There are some products that are legal in other countries and are just not legal here. So I take some of the investment products we’ve talked about earlier today, for example exchange traded funds. One of the things that makes crypto risky is that consumers may not understand the difference between one token and another token. And so they may want to diversify much as I own an S&amp;P 500 mutual fund. We don’t allow that in the United States, we do allow it in Canada. We allow it in Germany, Singapore, Portugal, and a number of other places. So if you’re a developer of those products, there’s no fuzzy line, it’s super clear. You can’t do that here.

       "Well Congressman, one thing I learned running my little agency is that the US, and this is not specific to crypto, the US is sort of unique among the developed countries in our fragmented approach to regulation. So when I hear people talk about the idea that we need one regulator for crypto, I would say we should first have one regulator for banks, but we have three of them, or if you’re an investment bank, five of them. So that’s inherent in the system that we’ve got. What I say to that is the last thing we need to do is add another regulator to a system that’s already got dozens of regulators. What we need to do instead is have parity for crypto activity along with traditional finance. If I’m a crypto lending platform, I should probably be regulated by the FDIC.</p>\n",

We already have a regulatory system, the laws are super clear how it works, but there’s something about crypto that scares people. I don’t know what it is. Maybe it’s just because it’s new. But I remember in my banking law class, when banks were first allowed to use computers to keep ledgers, people sued over that at the time I remember when I was a second year lawyer and we got email, and the ABA said lawyers couldn’t use email because it would travel over this mysterious network of computers. These all seem ridiculous today, but it seems like we haven’t really learned the underlying lesson which is technology usually advances human flourishing. We have a regulatory system.

Prior to the creation of the subcommittee on financial services, we had a terrorist financing task force that I chaired for about eight years. So I’m keenly sensitive to the issues around know your customer and AML. And I worked a lot with FinCEN, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, on traditional banking protections with regard to terrorist financing and money laundering. And I know that at the end of last year, FinCEN actually issued a rule making proposal to require banks and money service businesses to submit reports and verify the identity of customers involved with wallets for virtual currency. So this particular rule making focused on those wallets that were hosted in low compliance jurisdictions and were identified by FinCEN as wallets which were not hosted by a financial institution called unhosted wallets.</p>\n",

       "Thank you. Congressman Lynch for the question. It’s a very important question. First I would simply start by saying, I think FinCEN has done an excellent job at looking at the issues of money laundering, terrorist financing in the context of virtual assets, virtual currencies. They led the way as the first federal regulator, to in fact put in place rules around that back in 2013, that led firms like Circle, Coinbase and many others here to put in place licensing supervision around bank secrecy act, anti-money laundering provisions, and the like.</p>\n",

       "I think the specific issue at hand, which you are correct, we had some significant objections to was really two-fold. One was there was a introduction of an 11th hour rule making that did not have a significant public comment. And I think at the bottom of that issue is there are some really significant things about the way digital assets and blockchains work that we want to make sure if we’re going to be introducing rules around reporting, that they take account of the unique things with public blockchain infrastructures in particular. Notably, public blockchain infrastructures are in some ways like the public internet or the worldwide web or email. They’re open networks that anyone can connect to join and use.</p>\n",

       "And it’s one of the really powerful things that has made information exchange free. And I think it’s one of the things that we believe with digital assets on blockchains can make value exchange much more frictionless for people around the world. And then part of that is that there are the ability for an individual to self-custody assets with a piece of hardware or piece of software. That piece of software could be downloaded from an app store. And they’re self-custodying a stablecoin like USDC or a Bitcoin. And the software maker itself is not involved in facilitating a customer transaction. They’re really just a software developer providing technology that end users can use. And I think the rule as it was outlined would kind of be a square peg-round hole or a bit of a blunt force instrument.</p>\n",

       "And what we argued, and I think is hopefully going to bear fruit significantly over the next year, is that what we really need are ways to provide proof of digital identities. A firm like Circle or a firm like FTX or Coinbase or Paxos or other folks testifying here could provide a cryptographic proof that someone has been KYC-ed, and that proof could actually be carried around with them in a hardware wallet or a software wallet. And then you’d have the ability to know that you’ve got legitimate actors to be able to have the right information about users without having essentially more PII or personal identifiable information being broadcasted really broadly. And so I think our view was give the industry more time to develop technology that can allow these forms of transactions to happen, but still preserve privacy and take advantage of the really significant security benefits that come from cryptography.</p>\n",

I think the easiest way to understand it is let’s contrast blockchain transactions with normal banking transactions to see how much easier it is to trace them on a blockchain than it is in a banking transaction. So let’s imagine for a moment that… I would never do this because this would be flagrantly illegal, but let’s say I bought you lunch. Okay? And let’s say that afterwards you wanted to Venmo me your payment back, right? So you hit your Venmo button on your iPhone and you sent me money.

Once that’s been done, then there’s a debit from my account. It’s very complicated. And in any one of those steps, information could be lost.

Mr. Cascarilla, I want to touch briefly on the risk that stablecoins might pose to our broader financial system. The President’s Working Group’s report which we spent plenty of time talking about today, expressed concern that any perceived instability could trigger a run-on, on that stablecoin. In 2008, we saw the dangers of instability in fraud money market funds, and now rating agencies are saying that. So how do you respond to the assertion by the President’s Working Group that allowing stablecoins could cause systemic instability?</p>\n",

       "Thank you for the question. I think this is a crucial topic when it comes to stablecoins. I think the key point here is to define stablecoin. And depending on how you define it, creates different risks. If a stable coin is backed by only cash equivalents, essentially money that’s sitting in an FDIC insured bank account, or sitting in T-Bills that mature in three months, there is no risk of a run. It’s liquid cash. You’ve taken simply a dollar and you’ve tokenized it. And there’s very good uses for that, and there’s really good reasons to set it up that way.</p>\n",

And in that case, you start to have not really a stablecoin, but you have something that looks more like maybe a bank deposit. And in that case it would make a lot of sense, I think, for a banking regulatory regime to oversee it. And also it could be that it looks more like a money market fund because it’s backed by certain types of securities, and it would make sense for the SEC to oversee it.

We haven’t even touched on NFTs or Dows in this committee hearing today. And we think it’s important that there’s a nimble group that is constantly looking at the changes in crypto.

I understand the notion that if I go to a retailer that accepts that stable coin, then I can transact with them, presumably the lower cost of that retailer, hopefully my prices are lower on account of that and I can transact faster with them.

Earlier today in the hearing, Representative Velasquez asked about proprietary trading on the Coinbase platform. And in that moment, I believe you had told her quote that, “Coinbase does not engage in proprietary trading on our platform. All prices are established,” et cetera. However, in looking at the Coinbase rules under section 3.21 under Coinbase corporate ops, it says, “Coinbase Inc, which owns and operates Coinbase Pro and Exchange also its own corporate funds on Coinbase Pro and Exchange.” And I just wanted to give you briefly the opportunity to clarify.</p>\n",

One contention is that the vibe of crypto is a stick it to the man vibe, but in actuality, it’s dominated and controlled by big tech and Wall Street. While the culture may be somewhat accurately described, the notion that a handful of big tech leaders and Wall Street banks somehow created and now control crypto is absurd on its face.

Web 3 can turn this entire thing on its head in a very empowering way. So my question’s simple.

The rest of it we can come to. But in terms of the problems being solved, I think the first issue is the biggest critics of cryptocurrency have been the biggest banks. Those are the people who are the most concerned about the entry of stablecoins into the payment system, about the ability of crypto assets to build networks that are away from the clearinghouse. Those are the biggest critics. So I think that tells you a lot of what you need to know.</p>\n",

       "And the reason is because the way that Web 3 solves a lot of problems, it’s really twofold. First of all, it eliminates the toll collector role of traditional banks and traditional broker dealers. The main thing that they do is they employ large numbers of human beings, maintaining ledgers of account and allocating credit for a fee. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies do that without human beings and with no fee and the elimination of minimum account balance fees, the $25 wire transfer fee that your bank charges to give you three days to send money.

So these are where video games, one can play a video game and earn NFTs. Those NFTs are in game experiences. So if anyone here has young kids who are playing with Roblox, playing with Minecraft, playing with these, there’s in-game experiences where you can buy avatars, you can buy various things. These can become NFTs. These NFTs then can be sold for value. So what we’re having here is this kind of the concept of a play to earn. You can play a video game. You can earn money.

       "Thank you, Madam chair. And thank you so much for everyone that have been coming forward in regards to this important issue. Cryptocurrency like Bitcoin currently consumes enough energy to power a small nation, and that’s something that continues to be missed in this debate around this issue. The University of Cambridge analysis estimated that Bitcoin mining consumes 121 terawatt-hours a year. To put that in perspective for everyone, that’s more electricity than the entire country Argentina consumes. That’s more than consumption of Google, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft combined. One Bitcoin transaction, a single purchase sale, or transfer uses the same amount of electricity as the typical US household uses in more than a month. So this is really outstanding to me and many folks do not know this, many Americans and folks that are talking about this issue. So Ms. Dixon, can you explain why for cryptocurrency like Bitcoin that rely on proof of work model mining is such an energy intensive process?</p>\n",

       "Thank you for the question. This is a really important area, obviously in terms of sustainability and the focus on what we do in this space. We should always be trying to do it better and much more efficiently. In Bitcoin, the way that Bitcoin consensus is achieved is through really complicated math equations. So there’s a lot of energy that’s needed to be used to be able to make that happen. I know best about the consensus mechanism on seller, which is the Stellar Consensus Protocol, which can be done on a very small computer, any of the ones that you have in front of you. University of [Lund 03:59:21] did a study on the Stellar network itself, and the network is low in terms of energy consumption. It’s around 0.00022 kilowatts per hour for each transaction. That’s less than a transaction for Visa.</p>\n",

Again, there are many different ones out there and depending on the mechanism, it depends on the energy consumption. But it’s definitely important for us to be able to try to do this better, more efficiently and to consider the sustainability concerns around it.</p>\n",

I don’t know if the chairwoman knows this, but like in Montana, a coal fire generating station is now providing a hundred percent of its energy to Marathon Digital Holdings for Bitcoin mining under Power Purchase Agreement. Prior to the crackdown in China, it was estimated that nearly two thirds of all Bitcoin mining took place in China, included in regions with very heavy power generation sets in Mongolia and other areas. But Ms. Dixon, should the world central banks and governments be taking a more active role in monitoring and regulating cryptocurrency in order to bring energy consumption and carbon emissions in line with our own targets here in our country at the Paris Agreement.

So we constantly have to be doing that kind of analysis. I think that we all need to focus on minimizing the energy consumption as much as possible, and then think about how we can work with governments to be able to consider the best way to achieve the carbon neutral status that I think a lot of folks want us to get to.

How can policy makers accelerate that transition away from carbon intensive mining? We know our planet is burning.

I think that same kind of work can be done with all of the different of consensus mechanisms out there.

And I’m thinking, Mr. Brooks, of what you said about the practice of law with the advent of emails. I was a younger lawyer then and remember all the fears around it. As has been said, and this is really a follow up to what Mr. Green asked long ago, hours ago, it’s obviously clearly a fast growing and a bit mysterious market. Looking at the total cryptocurrency market cap over the last year, as some here have reported, it exploded from about 500 billion a year ago to now almost 3 trillion as of last month. But it’s also clearly a volatile, fast moving market. As of last night, the total market cap is back down closer to 2.4 trillion. Another example of volatility in Bitcoin, which lost half of its value over just two days in March before rebounding.</p>\n",

       "Thank you, Congresswoman. It’s good to see you again. I’ll just give you a very quick anecdote. When I was practicing law, I represented one of the largest mutual fund complexes in the United States and in their market room, they had a chart, a physical chart showing the US equity market from 1792 to the present. What I remember about this room is it was a full city block long and if you stood at the end of the room and looked at that chart, it was a straight line up and to the right. But if you walked right up close to the chart, you could very clearly see the Civil War and the Panic of 1907 and the Great Depression and all kinds of other volatility along the way.</p>\n",

       "What I would tell you is in the beginning of a fundamental technological revolution like this, the early days are going to see turbulence, but the long chart of crypto in only its 11 year history is up and to the right just like the US equity market. So what I would say is there are risks. There’s disclosures that ought to be had. There’s framework regulations that should be adopted. But the fact that the price goes up and down doesn’t make it any different from US equity markets in the first hundred years of the country’s existence.</p>\n",

       "Well, that’s a great comparison and probably a metaphor for other things that we are struggling with in our democracy. Hopefully the upward trend is the trend. Let’s pray that that is so. A little more specifically, all digital assets clearly don’t fit into our current fiscal regulatory frameworks. So we’re here to try to learn what are the right policies to make sure that this is appropriately regulated. Do we need to start from scratch and create an entirely new framework for crypto with a new regulator, such as been suggested by Coinbase? Ms. Haas, can you talk about Coinbase’s view that Congress should regulate digital assets under a new framework with a single regulator?</p>\n",

       "Thank you for the opportunity to clarify. So yes, we do believe that there’s benefits to having a single regulator that can address the broad strokes of crypto generally. I share a lot of the views that Mr Bankman-Fried had in his written testimony. I also share the views of Mr. Brooks, where you say if it is a security token, then it is going to fall under the SEC. If it is a commodity token, then it will fall under the [inaudible 04:11:49], but we have also new tokens here. And when you think about NFTs in an NFT marketplace, when you think about Bitcoin itself, when you think about these new protocols where all you’re doing is getting a right to governance in a protocol, they do not fit under the contours of existing frameworks and neat definitions.</p>\n",

       "Yes. Thank you. Paxos was the first company in the entire country to become regulated. We operate using a trust company status. And the reason we do that is because we don’t make loans and take deposits. So a trust company is actually safer than a bank. So that’s an example of using a state regulatory authority in order to oversee our business. I think having either our primary regulator that’s on the state basis or on a federal basis is what will allow there to be a consistent application of AML KYC rules, reserve rules, customer protection rules. So there isn’t a clear way to be able to do that right now. We feel this even ourselves as a trust company where we don’t have explicit reciprocity in a state by state basis. I think being able to create a clear parody across the board, as Mr. Brooks was saying, is very important for the industry.</p>\n",

The topic we talk a lot about also in this committee and an issue front of mind for many underserved communities around the United States. So Mr. Brooks, I’d love to get your thoughts on the relevance of today’s topic for financial inclusion and how the growth in digital assets and decentralized finance can actually drive inclusion, and can underserved communities benefit from these developments?</p>\n",

       "I love that question, and thank you for giving me a chance to address it. Couple of things. So first of all, let’s ask, why do we have so many underbanked people in the United States? And the answer is a combination of minimum balance fees, monthly account maintenance fees, and all kinds of other things that are a hallmark of the money center model that banking is built on. Right? If you talk to Mr. Allaire about his product, he would tell you they don’t have any minimum balance fees. They don’t have any monthly maintenance fees. You can keep your assets in a tokenized bank deposit for free. So that’s the first answer is there are no $10 a month fees. There are no $25 wire charges. Those things don’t exist that eat away at your life savings. A.</p>\n",

       "And B, the next most important thing about crypto is here you have an early stage asset, which unlike the IPO boom, unlike venture capital, doesn’t require that you know a guy or that you be well connected or that you be an accredited investor to participate. This is a chance for underrepresented communities to be in on the wealth creation stage of some new thing as opposed to coming in at the end. So what I always say is that’s the way you solve under representation is through wealth creation. This is an opportunity, and that is why there are more minority investors than white investors in crypto in the United States is because of this.</p>\n",

I think in significant ways, they want access to U.S. dollars, but they also want access to crypto. They want to have the ability to protect themselves when they’re in either politically unstable environments or economically unstable environments, or both.

The interoperability with the existing financial infrastructure means that individuals that don’t actually have bank accounts, but something like a MoneyGram relationship, which is in Texas, based in Texas, that we have on the Stellar Network, it allows these individual that have cash but they might not have a bank account, they can walk into MoneyGram, convert their cash into a digital asset, and then send that asset to their family, to their friends, to anyone that they choose using the blockchain.

So the end user who wants to go pick up their fiat at the local MoneyGram, for example, they will pay a fee, but there are no other intermediaries that are layered in top of that and the fees are much lower than those that you see in the traditional financial infrastructure.

I just would like you a better sense of the role centralized exchanges play with the flow of funds. For example, how do you keep track of tokens, transactions, and wallets?

A lot of younger people have grown up with the internet. They were born with the internet in their crib, so to speak, and I think have an expectation of value being able to be used the same way that they can share a JPEG photo or react to something. And so I think there’s just a familiarity and an expectation that, of course, everything’s going to be digital. And so I think the expectations are different. I think that a component of digital asset markets is this concept of democratizing access to financial markets, and digital asset markets do that. There is more democratized access. There are fewer barriers to entry for individuals and I think that affects the adoption rates in minority communities. It affects adoption rates more generally on some of those other demographics.

The current regime of regulation by enforcement in which entrepreneurs must negotiate with the SEC or the CFTC on a one off basis is not fair, it’s not efficient, or conducive to U.S. based innovation. Congress needs to provide clarity and predictability by statute and I’m ready to work with both my Democratic and my Republican colleagues to provide that. The rules of the road for Web Three can be a bipartisan initiative. The United States needs a primary crypto regulator that is tech and market structure neutral and that has three imperatives, it compels disclosure and transparency, it prevents fraud and abuse, and it promotes the efficiency and the resilience of the market. And this primary regulator should work with a self-regulatory organization as a counterpart in the private sector to establish one light touch rule book for spot and derivatives listings, custody requirements, token issuance, asset servicing, cross margining settlement, know your customer and anti-money laundering, disclosure and auditing, and, of course, stable coding standards.</p>\n",

       "Yeah. Thank you for the questions. I think the single biggest thing is just ensure the reserves are what they say they are. That is the fundamental large portion of the risk that could be posed by them is from both a consumer protection and a systemic risk perspective is, what if there is $1 trillion stablecoin with only $1 billion actually backing it? And so I think having daily attestations and periodic third party audits to confirm that the stablecoins are backed one to one with regulatory oversight of that process is by far the single most important piece of that.</p>\n",

       "I’ll add some thoughts here. I completely agree that this is the most important thing that the U.S. can do at the moment. It’s not clear exactly how you can trust a dollar stablecoin, and that’s unfortunate. Money is ultimately a product and the way money is working today for people leaves a lot to be desired. Being able to put a dollar into a blockchain environment solves so many problems that we’ve been talking about all day to day here. And I think that it’s crucial for us to be able to set a clear regulatory plan in place that creates parity across all of these different products. And so I think it’s really simple. If you have a primary regulator, you have clear reserves, you have made sure that you back them by cash, cash equivalence, that creates very much a level playing field for all different dollar back stablecoins. And then they’ll really be stable.</p>\n",

       "Thank you, Madam Chair, appreciate this hearing. Ms. Dixon, a question for you. As you know, my home state of Texas earlier this year created a more friendlier jurisdiction for crypto and blockchain in an effort to be a leader in that space. And I saw that MoneyGram, which has many employees in my district and is headquartered right outside of my district, you’ve developed a partnership with them. And I was just wondering if you could go into further detail what doing with MoneyGram. And then, for those that don’t know, MoneyGram is one of the premier money transfer operations in the world. There are countries that literally 20% of their GDP is transferred in by MoneyGram. So it’s a pretty important product for a lot of the world. I was wondering if you could talk about what you’re doing with them.</p>\n",
       "<p>Ms. Dixon: (<a data-wpel-link=\"exclude\" href=\"https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/FK4Sq9VozH4P5INV5eY8CoFR8T8IV1XBcC-elHVPodGKjdFPoGQhFRcOwBl1KkT2rJ2blSBNC-MIPAj12LvByFVR_gA?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=16569.65\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">04:36:09</a>)<br/>\n",
       "Yeah. I think that’s why it’s such an important part. Thank you so much for the question. It demonstrates not just the interoperability that blockchain has with the existing financial infrastructure, but it also demonstrates that you can actually offer services to traditionally unbanked or underbanked folks all over the world leveraging this kind of technology. And, finally, I think importantly from the MoneyGram standpoint and from [Remitter’s 04:36:32] standpoint, actually, it provides instantaneous settlement. So they don’t have IOU’s out there. They actually have the money in their bank account when they’re using the stablecoins, which is very important for us to be able to get right. So the MoneyGram relationship, which is in pilot right now in the United States, allows folks, you don’t need to have a bank account to be able to get assets put on the blockchain. Right now, the hardest part about blockchain is the on and off ramp.</p>\n",

       "We actually haven’t done that exceptionally well because, unless you have a bank account, it’s very, very hard to be able to get money into digital assets. The MoneyGram relationship could be one of many that actually demonstrates the ease of use that you can have. The beautiful thing about this is that MoneyGram, who acted very quickly, in less than two months was able to help to develop this technology and this integration with Stellar. There’s one part of it, but the other part of it is, all you have to have is a wallet that’s Stellar enabled. So, a wallet anywhere in the world. It doesn’t have to be a specific wallet to be able to then walk into MoneyGram, get assets onto the blockchain using your fiat, your local fiat. It’ll convert into USDC, which is Mr. Alair’s coin, and then you could have that in your wallet, you can generate yield on that, you can do lots of other things with respect to the assets that you have.</p>\n",

       "You could then send them to family in a different country, for example. And once this is global, which will be next year, you could then go into participating MoneyGram locations and have those assets converted into your local currency, which is very important. So it works very well with the cash economy and cash ecosystems, and it demonstrates the true interoperability with blockchain and traditional financial infrastructure, because that’s what MoneyGram is and has done exceptionally well. And it demonstrates the value that these traditional players bring because they’ve created this really important ecosystem and network of folks all over the world that have feet on the ground that really work with cash, the individuals that have cash, to be able to deliver value to them. Whether that be to be able to get it from family outside of their country or just to be able to convert these into digital assets. So it’s a really exciting and transformational opportunity, in my opinion, for blockchain because of the speed of use and the ease at which you can get money on and off the blockchain.</p>\n",

       " Earlier this year, I created a digital assets working group of democratic members to meet with leading regulators, advocates, and other experts on how these novel products and services are reshaping our financial system. This hearing, subsequent hearings on this topic will help this committee consider how to support responsible innovation that protects consumers and investors, safeguards our financial system from systemic risk, promotes financial inclusion, addresses environmental contents, as well as to consider a potential central bank digital currency. We have also held several subcommittee and task force hearings earlier this year to better understand the landscape of this industry. At today’s hearing, which I worked with a ranking member McHenry to organize, I look forward to engaging directly with this panel of cryptocurrency CEOs, whose company’s issue stable coins and provide an exchange to buy and sell digital assets, to understand where they think their products, services, and technologies are heading.</p>,\n",

       " Americans are increasingly making financial decisions using digital assets every day. Even some pension funds are beginning to invest in cryptocurrencies on behalf of retirees, despite the track record of volatility of cryptocurrencies as investments. The pandemic has also continued to contribute to working families looking for alternatives to rebuild their nest egg by investing in cryptocurrency. The rapid growth of this industry has also become more visible with celebrity endorsements and ATMs that exchange cash for cryptocurrency. However, several questions remain as to how traditional rules apply and whether regulators have sufficient authority to protect investors and consumers while maintaining market integrity and encouraging innovation. Currently cryptocurrency markets have no overarching or centralized regulatory framework, leaving investments in the digital aspect space vulnerable to fraud, manipulation, and abuse. Some cryptocurrency market exchanges and stable coin issuers have obtained state money transmitter and sale of checks, licenses from multiple states, and at least three cryptocurrency companies have obtained conditional approval for national trust bank charters from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.</p>,\n",

       " Thank you, madam chair. 2021 was the year of the cryptocurrency. More Americans than ever are taking notice of this transformational technology. DeFi, DOWs, NFTs, Web 3, jargon that was really once just used on crypto Twitter, they’re quickly becoming part of the lexicon. Technology and its adoption are moving fast. Entrepreneurs and innovators are building and deploying the next generation of the internet, and firms like the ones before us are the on-ramp for many Americans to participate in the digital asset ecosystem, but this panel’s only a bit of that broad ecosystem. And this is the first time Congress is having a hearing about cryptocurrencies in its fullness. But as with any new and fast growing industry, there are questions that need to be answered.</p>,\n",

       " I want to be clear though, this technology is already regulated. Now, the regulations may be clunky, they may not be up to date. I ask my friends, my policy maker friends here on the Hill this question: do you know enough about this technology to have a serious debate? Now, if the answer’s no, then we need to first seek to understand, to build up that understanding of this new technology so we can have a serious debate on how we appropriately respond and update regulations and perhaps laws. But I should be clear, the goal today is to listen, learn, and ask questions. This technology is new and exciting. It promises a new direction for financial economies, services, and products.</p>,\n",

       " I further ask this question though, how do we make sure as American policy makers that this cryptocurrency revolution, this technology revolution happens in the US and not overseas? There are a lot of we have to answer, but of course we need reasonable rules of the road. We know that. We don’t need kneejerk reactions by lawmakers to regulate out of fear of the unknown rather than seeking to understand. And that fear of the unknown and the move to regulate before understanding will only stifle America in ingenuity and put us at a competitive disadvantage. Throughout history, we’ve seen examples, countless harmful examples of overregulation around the world by governments. In the late 1800s, England reacted to the rise of cars with laws that required three people to operate vehicles at all times, one to drive, a second to fuel up the vehicle, and a third to stand in front of the car and wave a red flag.</p>,\n",

       " Now, Congress should not be dumb enough to raise a red flag around this technology revolution. We should embrace it, we should understand it, and we should be the international leaders in this space. Further example I would tell you is Skype, the video conferencing platform that may still be a little clunky, but was vital during the COVID shutdowns that we just experienced. And it was vital for some of our kids to even go to school, or even have hearings on this massive screen here. Skype was illegal in most of the world when it was launched. There wasn’t a regulatory infrastructure in place that allowed this novel technology, this new technology. And finally, when an invention called the internet began to boom, US lawmakers and regulators struggled to fully grasp the immense possibilities of this innovation out the gate. Now that was the early nineties, and I think we’re in a similar state with Web 3 30 years later, for Congress first to understand before we would seek to legislate. Now, it would be nearly impossible to go a day without using the internet to communicate. We know that. Or move from point A to point B. We know that. Or purchase necessities for our families. We know that. I would argue that the nascent technology we’re discussing today will have just as much impact on our daily lives, perhaps more. And that’s why we must get this right. My fear, however, is that we’ll have a partisan divide here. Well, my fear is that some of my Democrat colleagues have already made up their minds and they have regulatory bills that they’re going to file in order to stifle this innovation or to kill it before it fully grows and blossoms.</p>,\n",

Forcing the private sector to navigate unclear public statements and regulation by enforcement is the wrong approach. So is demonizing an entire industry based off the headlines guarded by a few bad actors. Understandably, there are concerns with the use of cryptocurrencies for nefarious activities. Let me address that. You know what else is used for nefarious activities? Cash. So let’s dispel the rumor now that digital asset technology’s a looming threat to our financial system. Instead, we should work to fully understand the opportunities the next generation of the internet could provide to Americans. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses. I look forward to having a deeper understanding as a policymaker about the ramifications for action by Congress before we understand this new technology that is now actually a decade old.

       " Good morning Chairman Waters, ranking member McHenry, and members of the House Financial Services Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to share my testimony with you today. My name is Jeremy Allaire and I’m the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Circle Internet Financial, a now eight year old company that has operated at the cutting edge of the digital assets market and digital currency technology innovation. Today, we’re at a pivotal moment in the development of the next major infrastructure layer of the internet, extending from an internet of data, content, and communications to an internet of value exchange and economic coordination. In a world where money becomes a core feature of the internet, the United States should be aggressively promoting the use of the dollar as the primary currency of the internet and leverage that as a source of national economic competitiveness. Circle’s mission is to raise global economic prosperity through the frictionless exchange of financial value, creating a world where financial inclusion, responsible financial services innovation, and protecting the integrity of the global financial system are not conflicting objectives.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Jeremy Allaire: (<a data-wpel-link=\"exclude\" href=\"https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/FK4Sq9VozH4P5INV5eY8CoFR8T8IV1XBcC-elHVPodGKjdFPoGQhFRcOwBl1KkT2rJ2blSBNC-MIPAj12LvByFVR_gA?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=776.42\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">12:56</a>)<br/>\n",
       " Today I’d like to address some of the key policy issues facing the United States around the rapid growth and use of dollar digital currencies, also known as stablecoins. Circle is the sole issuer of USD Coin or USDC, an innovation that brings the benefits of digital currency: fast, inexpensive, highly secure, global, and interoperable value exchange over the internet, without the downside of extreme volatility that has plagued most cryptocurrencies. USDC is helping to pave the way for digital dollars to be the leading currency of the internet. While stablecoins got started as a dollar settlement layer for digital asset trading markets, their use in everyday payments is expanding rapidly. Just in the past several weeks, Circle has signed on institutional customers who are using these services for small business payments, international remittances, and efficient payments for remote workers.</p>,\n",

       " Soon, we believe that dollars on the internet will be as efficient and widely available as text messages and email. As the recent president’s working group report on stablecoins highlighted, not all of these payment instruments are created equal, but by the same token, not all of them are part of an unregulated wild west as has often been portrayed. In our case, we have prioritized building, designing, and guarding the prudential standards for USDC inside of and conforming with prevailing US regulatory standards that apply to leading FinTech and payments firms. This approach has helped USDC to reach over 40 billion in circulation and has powered more than $1 trillion in on-chain transactions.</p>,\n",

       " The reserves back in USDC are held in the care, custody, and control of the US regulated banking system. These are strictly held in cash and short duration US government treasuries, and we have consistently reported on the status of these reserves and their sufficiency to meet demands for USDC outstanding with third party out of stations from a leading global accounting firm. With this growth comes in increasing responsibility to foster financial inclusion. To that end, we aim to deploy cash deposits across the country where we will allocate a share of USDC reserves, hopefully accruing to billions of dollars over time to minority depository institutions and community banks as a way of improving their balance sheets, but also ensuring that the future of payments and banking is more inclusive than the past. The president’s working group report on stablecoins has put forward a set of recommendations for establishing national regulatory supervision of firms, such as Circle.</p>,\n",

       " We support this effort and believe there can be strong nonpartisan support for the appropriate federal supervision of this highly strategic payments infrastructure. Well prior to the president’s working group report, we announced our plans to pursue a national banking charter from the OCC, and we continue prioritizing active engagement with all of the relevant federal and state banking regulators. There’s much work to do in defining the critical statutory requirements for stablecoins. At the same time, the technology of blockchains and digital assets are not standing still, and whatever the ultimate policy and regulatory outcomes, it is crucial that policy embraces and enables the United States to be global leaders in the development of the internet of value. As the committee works in earnest on these issues, we welcome active engagement and believe this to be one of the most important areas for economic infrastructure and growth in the coming decade.

I grew up in Stanford, California, went to MIT where I majored in physics, and I spent three and a half years as a quantitative trader after college. My goal has been to find ways to have a positive impact on the world and to maximize that, and to do so by supporting some really fantastic organizations. In 2017, I felt like it was time to try starting up my own thing, so I left my job and I moved out west and ultimately got involved in the [inaudible 00:17:50] and cryptocurrency ecosystem. I spent about a year trading and I, in late 2018, began with my co-founders, building out FTX.</p>,\n",

About a year and a half ago, we started up FTX US, our United States based in servicing operations. A few points on FTX in the broader cryptocurrency industry. The first is that I think that the industry has the potential to improve a lot of people’s lives. There are a lot of ways that this can happen. I think that the payments side of this gets a lot of attention, and rightfully so. Every time that a common consumer goes to a market to purchase goods, they pay multiple percent in fees to intermediaries. And that’s if they’re lucky.</p>,\n",

It can get embezzled by various third party scams in the middle. And in general, the global financial ecosystem is not one where sending assets to those who are important to you is easy to do. And this hits the people who are least off the hardest, who have the least access to the financial ecosystem as it exists today. When you look at the number of people who are underbanked or unbanked, both in the United States and globally, it’s indicative of a system that does not work for everyone. And this is a product of the intermediation involved, it’s a product of how the larger institutions have evolved, and it’s a product of payments infrastructure that is difficult and clunky enough to use that it just does not work for most people.</p>,\n",

The topic is an important one for anyone who cares about American competitiveness in the financial services sector, a financial ecosystem that empowers users over bank CEOs and other powerful central decision makers, and the next iteration of the internet in which individuals are able not only to read information and write content, but also to own a piece of the networks themselves. I am CEO of Bitfury Group, a company that provides a suite of infrastructure products and services that support various aspects of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, an ecosystem many of us today refer to as Web 3, since crypto assets generally represent either the rewards paid to participants for maintaining a particular decentralized network or an app that operates on such a network. Since 2011, Bitfury has designed and produced eight successive generations of ASIC chips and related equipment for conducting transaction validation activity on the Bitcoin blockchain, a process known informally as Bitcoin mining.</p>,\n",

I believe the committee’s topic today requires an understanding of three important threshold issues. First, a national policy agenda that takes crypto compliance seriously should assess whether it makes more sense to continue to keep crypto activities largely out of the regulated financial system or whether it makes more sense to bring them inside the system precisely so that they can be supervised and operated with appropriate levels of risk management.</p>,\n",

       " For example, is it consistent to take the position that only banks should be allowed to issue stablecoins, but then fail to grant bank charters to the largest issuers of stablecoins? That would, after all, bring stablecoin activity within the ambit of an existing national bank supervision system with which we’re all familiar. Or does it make sense to bring enforcement actions challenging certain crypto assets as unregistered securities, but then fail to allow those assets to be registered and trade on a national securities exchange subject to supervision by FINRA and the SCC? Second, Americans deserve to know what our national policy is for a decentralized Web 3 powered by crypto assets. Treating crypto as a single unitary activity whose main feature is a need for financial regulation would be like treating the original internet in the 1990s as primarily a tax policy issue. We didn’t do that then.</p>,\n",

Today, instead of focusing only on micro questions, such as whether a particular token is a security or whether a particular exchange traded fund may be offered, it would be worthwhile for the elected branches of government to grapple with the bigger questions, such as do we believe a user controlled decentralized internet is better than an internet largely controlled by five big companies? Do we believe that the financial services sector is any less subject to network effects than information and commerce were in earlier iterations of the internet? Do we trust big banks more or open source software more as a tool for maintaining ledges of account and allocating credit and capital?</p>,\n",

Third, crypto policy should take into account not only any new risks introduced into the system, but also the risk in the present system that are solved by decentralization. Having issued almost a billion dollars in civil money penalties against banks and bank executives during my tenure leading the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, it is clear to me that the present financial system has plenty of examples of risks and costs and safety and soundness problems that are being addressed in the current system. Shouldn’t we take seriously the possibility that algorithms and open source software that take a measure of human error, greed, negligence, fraud, and bias out of the system might actually make the system better on net, even if there are some new risks being presented that need to be understood and regulated?</p>,\n",

One relates to the effect of US crypto regulation on American competitiveness in both the technology and capital market sectors. There are a number of examples of US regulatory decisions that have driven legitimate activity offshore in ways that harm US investors, innovators, and workers. Can anyone explain, for example, why Fidelity Investments, one of America’s best known investment advisors, had to go to Canada to offer a Bitcoin ETF, or why physically settled crypto ETFs are safe and legal in Germany, Brazil, Singapore, and elsewhere, but somehow not in the United States?</p>,\n",

       " Chairman Waters, ranking member McHenry, and members of the committee, thank you for this opportunity. My name is Charles Cascarilla. I’m the CEO and co-founder of Paxos. During my 22 year career in financial services as an analyst, investor, and entrepreneur, I have witnessed the shortcomings and systemic risk for financial market infrastructure firsthand. Paxos is a regulated financial institution and blockchain infrastructure platform. Paxos’ customers include Bank of America, PayPal, MasterCard, Interactive Brokers, Credit Suite, and many others. We help financial institutions provide their clients with reliable, regulated access to digital assets. Paxos also offers a uniquely structured and regulated stablecoin, the Pax dollar. Each Pax dollar is fully backed by one US dollar. As a result, it is not volatile like other types of digital assets. However, it retains the same properties that make digital assets so appealing. It can be transferred nearly instantly overnight and on weekends, and it is programmable, secure, and traceable.</p>,\n",

       " Digital assets and blockchain technologies can create a more efficient, secure, and innovative financial system, and a more exclusive and equitable global economy. In the existing financial system, a person needs a bank account to safely store money, establish credit, earn interest, and borrow, yet according to the federal reserve, 18% of all Americans and 40% of black adults and 50% of adults without a high school degree are unbanked or underbanked. The current system is expensive and slow. International and even domestic money transfers can take days. At any given time, there are trillions of dollars worth of capital held up in transactions that have not yet settled. Digital assets are vastly more accessible. Anyone with a smartphone can download a wallet app to send and receive assets. No bank account is required.</p>,\n",

       " Transferring digital assets is instantaneous and convenient. They can be sent or received 24/7. There’s no waiting around for wire transfers or money orders to arrive, or for banks and stock exchanges to open, and transfers are often very inexpensive, in some cases costing just a penny per transfer. Digital assets can also reduce bias in finance. At its heart, blockchain is just a math equation. It is agnostic to a user’s race, gender, nationality, or income. And blockchain permanently and publicly records transactions, reducing errors, fraud, and systemic risk. A blockchain based financial architecture could settle trades on the same day, thus mitigating counterparty risk and eliminating the need for costly central clearinghouse. For our part, Paxos recently completed a successful pilot to offer same day security settlement in support of SEC chair Gensler’s goal of reducing settlement –</p>,\n",

Paxos believes regulation is essential for increasing public trust and digital assets and ensuring adoption. That’s why we sought oversight by a primary prudential regulator, even though we were not required to do so. Paxos became the first regulated trust for digital assets in the country, when it was approved by the New York state department of financial services in 2015. We adhere to the same anti money laundering and know your customer rules as banks. We are subject to regular examinations of our operations, procedures and capital levels. Our products are also regulated. Of the world’s three regulated dollar backed stablecoins, two are issued by Paxos. Unfortunately, the uncertain state of digital asset regulation is hampering the industry’s development. The solution is not to shoehorn digital assets into a regulatory system designed for earlier generations of financial assets.</p>,\n",

       " We have an opportunity to build a more efficient and effective financial system. We believe a primary prudential state or federal regulator should regulate digital asset companies and their products. Compliance standards need to be enforced. Regulation must ensure that customer assets are held segregated from the company’s balance sheet. For stablecoins, independent auditors should regularly attest that assets back in the token are always held in reserve. Those reserves should be held in bankruptcy remote accounts, and available to the issuer and not available to the issuer general creditors.</p>,\n",

We need the government’s support to create a new, more secure, more competitive financial system. The benefits of getting this right are enormous, but so are the consequences of getting it wrong.

       " Sure. Thank you for inviting me to testify today. I’m honored to be here. My name is Denelle Dixon and I am the CEO and executive director of the Stellar Development Foundation. I took this role and joined the blockchain more than two and a half years ago. Prior to that, I was the chief operating officer of the Mozilla corporation, where I spent a lot of my time advocating, among other things, openness and interoperability in web technologies. It’s those same policy priorities that drew me to blockchain. An industry that I believe can learn from past mistakes made in other areas of web development. Stellar is an open, permissionless, decentralized network, that is optimized for payments. There is no single entity, including SDF, that controls the code base of the network or its growth. You don’t need permission to use this technology, just like the underpinnings of the internet, it is ready and available for use to anyone.</p>,\n",

       " Importantly, and especially in the context of this hearing, Stellar was designed for asset issuance, making it possible to create, send and trade digital assets backed by nearly any form of value. And also is designed with compliance tools built in to help those asset issuers meet their own compliance obligations. The Stellar platform is a pioneer of tokenization, optimized for Fiat backed asset issuance before stablecoin was even in a word. And over the last few years, an ecosystem of businesses and users have built use cases around Stellar based stablecoins due to their incredible utility to solve many of the problems we see in today’s payment landscape. Despite the headlines, what’s happening in the world with blockchain, with cryptocurrency and stablecoins is not just lending, trading and borrowing. Other use cases are active and focused on solving real world challenges using the technology.</p>,\n",

       " So, let me start with MoneyGram international MoneyGram is building a solution on Stellar that enables seamless conversion between cash and digital assets. MoneyGram’s network integrates with the Stellar blockchain to able cash funding of digital accounts and payout in different currencies of the consumer’s choice, using stablecoins. It’s using Circle’s USDC coin. In real terms, consumers will be able to send value in the stablecoin and easily convert to local Fiat currency for instant pickup for thousands of participating MoneyGram locations globally. This is in pilot phase right now in the US, and is expected to be widely available in 2022. Another example, Leaf Global FinTech has built the solution for refugees and cross-border goods traders who are vulnerable to theft while carrying across borders. So, with Leaf’s wallet, these users can save their money in multiple currencies, benefit from cross-border transfers and pay for goods and services.</p>,\n",

       " That functionality is only possible because they leverage Stellar’s ability to issue assets, to issue stablecoins and exchange value with low transaction fees and high speeds. This use case is live and operational today. The last use case I’d like to touch on is one that is in development. Tala is best known for its mobile lending app, which enables its customers to apply for a loan and receive an instant decision, regardless of their credit history. Tala is now working to expand their offering by using Stellar assets and stablecoins, to help their current customers with credit, by allowing borrowing, spending, saving, investing, and sending and receiving. There are many more valuable use cases in the Stellar ecosystem that I would love to be able to share with you today. But I would just briefly like to mention that in a recent report from the G20 and IFC, there were five Stellar ecosystem companies named for their innovative solutions in digital finance, supporting MSMEs. Use cases like these are in varying states of maturity, but their current and potential value is undeniable.</p>,\n",

       " And none of these use cases would be possible without stablecoins. Stablecoins are a core technological component. And by extension, that means stablecoin are essential on delivering on financial inclusion. So, that brings me to the PWG report on stablecoins. The PWG report raises legitimate risks, but it’s recommended solutions that go too far. Specifically to limit stablecoin issuance to insured depository institutions is not narrowly tailored to the actual risk of stablecoin arrangements for the simple reason that although there are outliers, most stablecoins, unlike bank deposits, are fully reserved. Instead, we advocate for a reg approach that it focuses more on stablecoin reserves by requiring stablecoin arrangements be fully reserved by appropriate assets, requiring reserves to be held as insured depository institutions, creating clear standards for regular audit and public disclosure of stablecoin reserves and key contractual terms regarding redemption, and by making it clear that payment stablecoins are not securities.</p>,\n",

       " Of course, regulators must be empowered to oversee these requirements. The framework should allow oversight through state banking supervision, or a narrowly tailored charter of the OCC. In our view, this would promote the safety and soundness of stablecoin arrangements. We’ve started to see how in innovation can be hampered in other parts of the world when regulators and lawmakers react prematurely. In Nigeria, stablecoins and blockchain technology were eliminating costly foreign exchange and transaction fees and slow processing times until the Central Bank of Nigeria abruptly ended that business model. And many innovators had consequently been stopped in their tracks. As we walk away from this hearing, I urge you to look at the industry and technology beyond the narrow lens of applications that often dominate the news. Thank you for having me here today.

We believe sound regulation is central to fueling crypto innovation and adoption. That is why we introduced our Digital Asset Policy Proposal, which we refer to as dApp. The dApp Assessed the challenges of the existing regulatory framework and proposed a four pillar solution. First, we believe the government should recognize digital assets under a new comprehensive framework that recognizes the unique technological innovations underpinning digital assets. Second, the responsibility for this new framework should be assigned to a single federal regulator. This regulator would be charged with establishing a registration process for intermediaries, which we refer to as marketplaces for digital assets. Third, this new framework should have three goals to ensure holders of digital assets are empowered and protected. A, we believe in enhanced transparency through robust and appropriate disclosure requirements. B, we want to protect against fraud and market manipulation.

       " Thank you very much. I now recognize myself for five minutes for questions. Mr. Cascarilla, I’m a bit concerned about company, Paxo’s partnership with Facebook, which is now calling itself Meta. As you know, Facebook has attempted several times to enter the cryptocurrency market starting in 2019, they founded the Libra Association, based in Switzerland, with the goal of creating a stablecoin, but suspended its activities after this committee held hearings. And I, along with other members, and US regulators, raised significant concerns leading to a number of Libra association members pulling out. Now in partnership with Paxos and Coinbase, Facebook has launched a pilot project with this digital wallet, Novi, for a limited number of individuals in the United States and Guatemala to send and receive money using your stablecoin known as USDP, or Pax Dollar. As you know, one of the recommendations in the recent president’s working group report focuses on mitigating systemic risk posed by stablecoins, as well as concentration of economic power concerns.</p>,\n",

       " The report among other things recommends legislation that stablecoin users must comply with activity restrictions that limit affiliation with commercial entities, similar to restrictions most banks face to promote the separation of banking and commerce. While your partnership with Facebook is reportedly a pilot, limited to a number of users in Guatemala and the United States, what is stopping Facebook from the future allowing its nearly 3 billion, monthly active users to make payments and save funds with the Pax Dollar, or other previously issued stablecoin through a Novi wallet? If this were allowed at such a scale, how not undermine the US dollar and the world’s reserve currency? Mr. Cascarilla, are you still muted? Can you hear me?</p>,\n",

       " There we go. Sorry about that. Thank you for the question, Chairwoman. So, I think it’s important to note in the case of Novi, that they are a customer Paxos just like any other customer of Paxos. We have an open product, they could use that product in the open market, they decided to come to Paxos. And I think they did that because we have the most regulated stablecoin product. And I think that was an important decision for them, that they wanted to use a well regulated product. And I think another important point here is, Novi is our customer, that’s a subsidiary of Facebook Meta. But Novi itself is a regulated money services business.</p>,\n",

And so, in terms of the Novi usage of our product, it’s just like anybody else, just like if they had a bank account, which they do, and they were using.

We’re trying to level set here for policymakers. So, originally the internet was a read-only format, in essence, we’re consuming information. And then there’s additional layers that we place on. It became much more interactive. But counterintuitively, much more interactive, but much more centralized, in web 1.0 and web 2.0. What we’re hearing now is web 3.0. Policy makers need to understand the nature of web 3.0. This is a hearing about a component of web 3.0. Now, along those lines, what are the characteristics that defined web 1.0 and web 2.0?</p>,\n",

       " Mr. McHenry, thank you very much for that question. I think that’s critical to understanding what we’re all trying to build here. So, the characteristic of web 1.0, if people remember their original AOL account, was an ability to look in a curated walled garden at a set of content that was not interactive, but was presented to you on AOL the way that TIME magazine used to show you the articles they wanted you to see inside of their magazine, just you could see it on a screen. The innovation of web 2.0 was that suddenly you could not only read content, but you could also write content. This is when the blogosphere became a big thing. People remember this from the late 90’s, the early 2000’s. The reason for the centralization of the internet of course, was that all of that activity was being monetized by a very small number of companies.</p>,\n",

       " Facebook, as the Chairwoman mentions, Google and then two or three other companies. What makes web 3.0 different is the ability to own the actual network. And that’s what crypto assets themselves represent, is an ownership stake in an underlying network. So, when you hear people talk about, for example, layer-1 tokens, what they mean is, this is your reward for providing the ledger maintenance services, the computing power to the network, that on web 1.0 and two was done by Google, right? So, now people in my hometown of Pueblo, Colorado can actually own the Ethereum network, but they can’t own the internet, that’s owned by Google and a few other companies. That’s what the project of crypto is all about, is allowing people to directly own the networks that have native assets that are supporting it.

       " So, the concept is that you have application layer tokens, and you have protocol layer tokens. So, if I’m an owner of Bitcoin, let’s say that I’m a miner of Bitcoin, somebody who actually creates Bitcoin. The Bitcoin is the reward I receive for doing the work to keep the network operational. And that allows me to own a piece of the Bitcoin blockchain. Or take Ethereum, which is easier to understand, the Ether token represents an ownership stake in the network. But on top of that network are all kinds of apps that get built on the network, much like the apps on your phone depend on the underlying network existing that lets the phone operate.</p>,\n",

       " And so, people will make judgements about which network is likely to win, and they will invest in the tokens in that network much the same way you might invest in Google stock because you think Google is going to scale access to the original internet. The difference being here, you can vote on what happens in the future of a proof-of-stake network, for example, you can get rewarded through a proof-of-work token for maintaining a ledger on something like Bitcoin, but the real message here is that what happens on the decentralized internet is decided by the investors, versus what happens on the main internet is decided by Twitter, Facebook, Google, and a small number of other companies.</p>,\n",

So it’s very simple in terms of how it can get from one point to another. And it does so very, very quickly. The importance of that is it actually can cross borders much more simply than anything else that’s out there today. So the value of blockchain is the ability to send from the United States, for example, and send to another country without having to reconcile with all the different software and intermediaries that exist today. So it eliminates intermediaries. It creates less friction in the marketplace, and it allows users who don’t have bank accounts today, or who choose not to get bank accounts or have been de-risked by banks from being able to, to be able to access this technology very cleanly because they can do so with a wallet.</p>,\n",

One of the historical differences between banks and stable coin issuers is that banks in this country historically have been engaged in multiple different kinds of financial intermediation and risk taking functions. Banks typically engage in three different things, deposit taking, lending, and payments. The core feature of stable coins is they’re a new payments technology and payments are one of the core things that banks do, right? So banks historically innovated in payments by first having check clearing, then later having travelers checks, then later being prepaid cards and things like that.</p>,\n",

       " Stable coin is just the faster, most modern way of transmitting those values. Stable coin issuers, of course, don’t present all of the risks that banking presents. They don’t typically engage in lending or anything else. And this is one of the reasons why at the OCC, we look very carefully at the possibility that payment companies like American Express in a different generation, circle today might possibly qualify for bank charters. They’re engaged in a core banking function, but not in the other banking functions. It’s to my point earlier that sometimes crypto is reducing risk, not increasing risk.</p>,\n",

       " I think that there’s a really big opportunity with respect to blockchain. I think when you mentioned before about tokenized assets, there already are tokenized interest in real estate that exist on Stellar, for example, or in fractionalized interest in US stock. So there’s opportunity for growth there. With respect to what we have with blockchain and what can be accessible, that banks already have available out there, but when they de-risk populations and they de-risk individuals out of the banking infrastructure, they can actually access accounts, hold assets, hold their assets into a digital framework, and then do a lot of the same things that you can do at banking institutions. But these individuals couldn’t get access to it before. So I think blockchain create that financial inclusion that we’re all talking about and that we all want to get to. And it does show I think with, as Ms. Haas indicated with the different layers, the infrastructure layer and the application layers, there’s so much creativity that’s happening now. So I think we have a long road ahead of us with respect to this technology.</p>,\n",

Bitcoin, for example, lost half of this value over two days in March. And it rebounded of course later on, but there are many problems leading up to the global financial crisis that seem to be manifesting themselves in the market currently. Easy credit, via margin investing, lack of transparency, the lack of transparency that I’d like to see, and adequate financial disclosure is not readily available. With the explosive growth in cryptocurrencies, at what point should we become concerned about the possibility of a bubble? At what point should we become concerned about the possibility of a bubble? Let’s start if we may with Mr. Brian Brooks.</p>,\n",

       " Well, thank you, Congressman Green. It’s terrific to see you again. And I always find your questions extremely perceptive. What I would say about that question is a lot of the price volatility of cryptocurrency has to do with the early stage of the market and the thinly traded nature of the asset compared to, for example, US real estate, global equities, or anything like that. I think the message I’d land with this committee in response to your question, however, is some of the things that make US equity and debt markets more stable and less volatile have to do with the fact that there’s a lot more price discovery in those areas. And what I mean by that is in the US, we have regulated equity mutual funds. We have derivatives products and futures products that allow the free trading on a 24/7 basis that provides the market with forecasts of what’s happening in the ecosystem.</p>,\n",

       " In the world of crypto, the US hasn’t responded by developing those tools for price discovery yet. And so the result in a relatively new, relatively thinly traded market is that one person unwinding their position can have a massive effect on the price. The last point I would just make very quickly is something like 80% of Bitcoin holders have never sold a Bitcoin. And so when you hear about a day when there was a giant price drop in Bitcoin, often it turns out that there was one or two large traders who were unwinding a leveraged position, and the vast majority of holders have enough confidence in it that they’ve literally never sold a unit of it. So I would argue we need more liquidity and more price discovery to a tamp down volatility, not less.</p>,\n",

So they understand you look at user experience, you look at UX design, all of these things are really, really important. And as we saw in the early days of the web, it happened, it came together. We became better at educating the audience about what’s available and what’s out there. The nice thing about blockchain is you have immutability, you have records that are out there that can’t be changed. This information is already leveraged by chain analysis, for example, in Elliptic, to demonstrate the different things that are happening on chain.

       " Let me first ask my question to Mr. Allaire. As you may be aware, communities of color often rely on minority depository institutions or community development financial institutions to safely do business and get access to crucial banking needs. And given an important role as well as the challenges that they face, I’ve been a long advocate for robust partnerships whereby MDIs and CDFIs can leverage new technologies to better serve their communities, as well as deploy Circle actually for using and exploring such partnerships and creating an initiative to deploy and share USD coin reserves into these MDIs and CDFIs, enhancing financial inclusion. So my question really to you is can you provide us a status update on where Circle is in implementing this program and what sorts of systems will be developed to ensure the long term success of the program?</p>,\n",

       " Thank you, Congressman Meeks. I appreciate the question very much. For those on the committee that are not familiar, we recently announced a new broad based company initiative called Circle Impact. It includes several key initiatives. First and foremost, something I did reference in my testimony as well is an initiative to take what we hope will be billions of dollars of the deposits that are held behind USDC and actually place those with minority deposits institutions and community banks throughout the United States. I think one thing that’s important to understand is that unlike a bank that wants to maybe hoard its deposits for its own lending business. As a full reserve model, we’re not in the business of lending. And so it’s a tremendous opportunity for us to work closely with banking institutions that could benefit from strengthened balance sheets, that could benefit from what that in turn can do to open up credit and lending and other opportunities in these underserved communities.</p>,\n",

       " So this particular initiative is one that we’ve just began. We expect to have the first wave of that in place by the end of the first quarter. We are also looking to coordinate with federal banking regulators who have their own initiatives that are focused on supporting MDIs and community banks. And we view this as a really critical and strategic part of what we can do to foster a more inclusive financial system. Final comment is simply that we believe that the technology of digital currency, the frictionlessness, the way in which individuals with mobile devices can actively participate. And not just domestically, but interacting with family members around the world and safely exchanging value, that these can also bring significant benefits to these communities. And we will certainly keep the committee up to date on progress with this initiative.</p>,\n",

       " Well, Mr. Luetkemeyer, it’s terrific to see you again. And I’d give you a couple of thoughts on that important written question. One is if we start with Stablecoins, before we talk about other crypto assets, I’ve said for a long time that the secular reduction in dollar holdings as a percentage of global central bank holdings is alarming. And this has been going on for more than 10 years at this point. So dollars is a share of the European Central Bank, the Japanese Central Bank, et cetera, has shrunk from 80 plus percent to more like 60 plus percent in a short amount of time. What that tells me is that in the future with the rise of China and other major economies, the US dollar can’t take its primacy for granted. And we need to start thinking about competing on utility, on features, not just based on a post World War II monetary system that we could take for granted for the last two generations.</p>,\n",

       " And that’s one of the reasons that I’ve been such a supporter of internet enabled dollars, which allow us to compete on features not only on history, I think that’s really critically important. The second thing I would tell you, as we enter year 11 or 12 of a highly inflationary environment, after all, we’ve been printing enormous numbers of new dollars since the financial crisis, there will come a time gradually then suddenly when the attractiveness of the dollar relative to other currencies could change. One of the benefits of the crypto economy is that it creates some counter incentives on the part of the Fed to do that kind of policy because people will flee to other kinds of assets. And that sort of market competition is something that I think will ultimately shore up our monetary policy and keep the dollar where it rightfully ought to be, which is as the dominant reserve currency it’s been for all of our lives.</p>,\n",

Mr. Brooks, good to see you back in front of our committee and to all of our witnesses, thank you for your testimony. Mr. Brooks, I will start with you is a bit of a follow up to Ms. Wagner’s question, but do you think Congress needs to introduce legislation to provide more definitional clarity with respect to digital assets? And if so, do you have any specific suggestions?</p>,\n",

       " Well, I really appreciate that question. That is the most important issue in the short term for the industry. And so let me just pick up where Mrs. Wagner left off. If the question is, is the current test clear, it’s clear in the sense that we know what it is. It’s not clear in that it’s a four factor balancing test. So I often think about what, the US trucking industry would be like, if the truckers didn’t know that the speed limit was 75 miles an hour, they just had a four factor test of general safety having to do with how much sleep they got the night before, the overall size of their payload and other factors. People need to know what the speed limit is.</p>,\n",

       " In my old agency, the OCC, what would happen is a bank would come to us with a new activity proposal and we would give them an answer. We would either give them a nonobjection or we would not give them a nonobjection and it was very clear whether they would be allowed to access that. What happens in the United States is you have a new crypto project and you walk into the SEC and you describe it in great detail, and you ask for guidance and they say, “We can’t tell you, and you list it at your own peril.” So whether this comes from legislation that defines what is a security and what isn’t a security, or whether it comes from Congress in the form of legislative discretion to an agency to say, what is a security, I would argue that a four factor balancing test is no better here than it is as truckers drive down the highway, guessing what safe is.</p>,\n",

       " Yeah. Well, thank you for that. The best test that is out there is a test that several of us on this panel actually helped to develop about three years ago, as part of an industry organization called the Crypto Rating Council. When I came to see several of you several years ago, in connection with the Crypto Rating Council, the way I described it to you was it’s sort of like motion picture ratings for crypto. We don’t know authoritatively what’s a security and what isn’t, because no authority will tell us. But what we can do at least is we can tell you the difference between an R rated asset and a PG rated asset, and people can make their risk tolerance judgements. So the way that process works is it’s an objective quantitatively based process that asks several dozen questions about the asset across each of the dimensions of the Howey Test. It gives you a number and that number tells you how close you might be to danger and how far away you-</p>,\n",

       " Thank you, Congressman Barr, I’m happy too. I think the first difference is that Stablecoins are operational and growing in the market today and they’re built on an open internet technology model. So when we think about all of the things that we’ve seen built on the open internet on these open protocols and networks, whether it’s ubiquitous information exchange, communications, interaction around the world, that same open internet model is the foundation for Stablecoins and so I think that’s a fundamental difference. A CBDC, which is a concept right now, it’s not operational would very likely be a very closed loop technology that’s tightly administered and run by the government and would unlikely be accessible in the same way that these open networks are accessible. And so I think that’s a critical difference, but I would come back to the most important, which is that most payment system innovations in the world have been driven by the private sector and I think what’s taking place today with digital currency is no different-</p>,\n",

       " I think so, yes. I mean, coming back to this and I’ll try and make this point concisely. The United States and the US dollar is winning the digital currency space race today. Dollar Stablecoins are doing trillions of dollars of transactions, the experimental beta of a Chinese yuan, which is government controlled, and China has done $10 billion of transactions. So the United States is winning. This has potential to grow at a very significant speed around the world and benefit the US dollar and benefit American businesses and households. And so I think that’s one really, really critical thing to understand and I think the primacy of this infrastructure and the development of this infrastructure, it is a strategic national security and national economic priority for the United States.

These things are all great, but it’s interesting that most of the people that I know that have invested in cryptocurrencies, not because of that, it’s because they think they can get rich quick.

I would agree with the fact that there are passer buys and then there are people who are actively building and who are very close to the technical innovation and I think like investments in technology companies, or in other businesses that we see in the stock market, you have people who are investing, because they think it’s a business or a product that might go up, they may not understand the details of a given pharmaceutical company’s science, but they believe that perhaps it’s an area of innovation and they want to invest in it. And so I do agree that there is that distinction, but I think, it’s certainly incumbent in all of the industry participants to ensure that there’s great amount of disclosure, financial literacy around these products.</p>,\n",

       " But more importantly, coming back to the comment about the dollar. I think there is this growth in digital assets as a new kind of asset class. And I think what’s important to note is understanding those in contrast to Fiat currencies, many of the digital assets. In fact, I think the overwhelming majority of the digital assets are commodities that are, have utility that are used to power, some kind of technology network or protocol, more thought of like an oil or gas than a Fiat currency. So they exhibit those properties and I don’t think those will ever rival the dollar. I think they’ll grow in value because they’re utilized to help facilitate all kinds of activity on these web three applications and networks. And I do believe that with innovations like Stablecoins and dollar digital currencies, we could actually see a dramatic amount of growth in the use of the dollar globally-</p>,\n",

I mean, the digital dollar can do all the things that you guys were talking about today with the exception that it is a Fiat currency, that wouldn’t be as easily manipulated by some nefarious group, because it would be controlled by the Fed and the United States of America. I mean, I do have great apprehension that you have these cryptocurrencies that are used by drug traffickers are used by people trafficking other human beings, and there’s no good way to control it. So I’m all for digital currency, but why not the dollar? Why can’t the dollar be the digital currency? Why can’t we once again, dominate in that 60, 80%, but maybe even higher with a digital dollar? That to me makes much more sense and it’s much more protected and people won’t have the risk, but anyway, I yield back my time, but I did find its very interesting discussion. Thank you.</p>,\n",

And when I’m trying to wrap my head around a new topic like cryptocurrencies, I try to relate it back to something I understand like baseball or business. Now some of you may know this, but modern day baseball can really be attributed to Babe Ruth. He brought in the live ball era of the time and introduced power to the baseball diamond. And before this teams would play small ball, that was very conservative where teams would literally play for one, run a game. The entire objective was simply to get the ball in play so they could try to steal their way around the bass pass. And there was nothing wrong with this old way of playing.</p>,\n",

       " Well, Mr. Williams, as a long suffering Dodgers fan, I share a lot of the things you’re talking about. And I think the era you’re talking about was an era when baseball went from focusing on not losing to an era where it focused on winning. And winning and not losing or not the same thing. So I come back to Mr. Vargas’s question a second ago, which I think is the right way to answer your question. Mr. Vargas asked the question of people have the potential to lose a lot of money, these things are volatile, they’re risky, how do we protect them from those kinds of issues? There are two ways of answering that. One is to prevent as many people as possible from accessing this amazing technology. For example, the way the current legal regime works is certain kinds of assets can only be purchased by accredited investors, meaning rich people.</p>,\n",

       " So the only people who can get rich on this are people who are already rich. That’d be one way of protecting people from losing money is to make sure that only the richest can access it another way of addressing it would be to make it safer. The way that we made equities safer 40 years ago. We created mutual funds, diversification, sector funds, and other things that make it easier for regular Americans from places like my hometown in Colorado to buy equities, without having to be stock experts. Strangely in the US, we’ve refused to do that out so far, so we don’t allow crypto mutual funds. We don’t allow people to diversify the way that they do in Canada, Germany, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates in a series of other regulated economies around the world. So I would argue the way to win is to bring more people into the system more safely, not to keep them out at their own peril.</p>,\n",

Many of them trade on leverage. And so, when you look at leverage, you made a lot of news by saying, we’re capping people at 20 times leverage.

The first thing that I’ll say is in cryptocurrencies, in digital assets, as like essentially every other financial asset in the world, more volume trades through futures contracts than through the spot asset.

Again, you’ve heard me say it before this morning, but you have on this panel, a big stablecoin issuer who has applied for a bank charter. Doesn’t look like they’re going to get it. Easiest way to supervise that would be let them in the banking system and have the OCC have authority over them. So I’d start with that.</p>,\n",

       " The second point is lots of these decentralization protocols are designed to solve the exact problems that create the need for enforcement in the first place, because most enforcement in the securities and banking system is about some combination of human error, human negligence, human greed, or human bias. And the point of some of these decentralized systems is to take that out and have an open source piece of software everybody can look at and do those things algorithmically.</p>,\n",

       " Thank you, Madam Chair, and to our witnesses. I’d like to focus on what I think is the crucial importance of having a secure digital identity for crypto asset transactions. First, regarding controlled anonymity for a prevention of criminal activities. And it seems to me that if we wish to prevent crypto assets from being used, for example, for ransomware or other criminal payments, that there is no logical alternative to having all crypto transactions associated with a legally traceable identity, some one who can be extradited if they do something criminal. And which these can be pseudonymous to market participants and to the public, but then must be capable of being de-anonymized pursuant to the action of a court in a trusted jurisdiction. Do any of you disagree with that conclusion that this is a necessary condition for prevent, for example, ransomware? So let the record show that they no one raised objection to that statement.</p>,\n",

       " So I think that’s very significant. So we have to start planning for a system, where in a court, in a suitable jurisdiction can actually de-anonymize any legitimate crypto asset. Okay. And now that is relevant to crypto assets such as stable coins or CBCs that have stable valuations, but still could be used for criminal activities. But for crypto assets which are speculatively traded, then we also have an additional worry, which is abusive trading practices. In that case, we need to know not only the beneficial owner behind a trade, but there has to be a uniquely identified beneficial owner. There has to be a regulator that can see, “Oh, this is a wash trade, because even though they look like separate pseudonymous IDs, they are in fact the same person.” And so that, historically, in trading that has required to have a regulator that can see the true beneficial owners. We spent a decade trying to get the beneficial owner onto the consolidated audit trail, which probably you’re aware of. So do you think that is also a logically necessary condition to prevent wash trades and similar abuses? Yeah. Mr. Bankman-Fried</p>,\n",

We’re responsive to governmental inquiries about that. We’re overseen by the CFTC on that with FTX US derivatives. I also think that this is a powerful argument in favor of having harmonized regulatory and market frameworks, in particular, between different asset classes. Where if you end up with a different regulatory framework for the market’s regulation of Bitcoin, Bitcoin derivatives, stable coin, stable coin derivatives, Ethereum, Ethereum derivatives, and other assets, you end up making it not just riskier and harder and more annoying for the user to access and more overhead for the industry, but you make it hard to have consistent regulatory oversight of a fractured regime.</p>,\n",

Now, in terms of tax payments. It seems to me that if there was simply the requirement for any digitally traded asset to be associated with pseudonymized, basically, a tax ID that you have an API provided by the government that says, “Give me a pseudonymous tax ID,” and that be put publicly on the blockchain, and that that blockchain be listed with the tax authorities, that then that tax authorities could just run a piece of software and calculate how much tax everyone owed.

They are about security. So one of the biggest problems, when you think about the biggest cyberhacks we’ve ever had in the United States, is how long it took for us to figure out that they occurred.

And so unlike normal networks where one bad guy can defeat the entire system, here you have to have thousands of computers agreeing at the same time that the change can be made.

So on the compliance side, I think the use of VPNs to avoid geolocation and to avoid sort of geofencing is something that three years ago was effective and useful. And the industry has developed lots of technologies that make that much, much harder today. So some of these decentralized tools, several of the companies have been mentioned already Chainalysis, Elliptic, and some others, have an ability to actually trace IP addresses based on probabilistic sort of network information.</p>,\n",

A full reserve digital currency model such as USDC, where a 100% of the assets are fully in high quality liquid assets such as cash and short duration US treasuries, is not the same as a bank deposit where the bank is in turn taking the deposit and rehypothecating it and lending it.

These all seem ridiculous today, but it seems like we haven’t really learned the underlying lesson which is technology usually advances human flourishing. We have a regulatory system. Let’s use it.</p>,\n",

But what concerned us about the drafting of the infrastructure bill specifically to the tax provisions was that these are complex issues. Crypto taxation is complex. The technology has new players in this space and that we didn’t have the public comment period that we would typically have for something so complex.

       " Thank you madam chair. Great hearing. I want to thank all of our witnesses as well. Prior to the creation of the subcommittee on financial services, we had a terrorist financing task force that I chaired for about eight years. So I’m keenly sensitive to the issues around know your customer and AML. And I worked a lot with FinCEN, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, on traditional banking protections with regard to terrorist financing and money laundering. And I know that at the end of last year, FinCEN actually issued a rule making proposal to require banks and money service businesses to submit reports and verify the identity of customers involved with wallets for virtual currency. So this particular rule making focused on those wallets that were hosted in low compliance jurisdictions and were identified by FinCEN as wallets which were not hosted by a financial institution called unhosted wallets.</p>,\n",

So Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Allaire, your firms in particular were vocally opposed to that rulemaking, and I heard your responses to Mr. Foster and to others regarding identity. And I want to try to understand, can you share why the transactions involving virtual assets and payments involving those wallets that are quite similar to Western Union transmissions or Moneygrams, why you objected to what looks like a fairly similar regulatory approach? Mr. Allaire if you might take a crack at it.</p>,\n",

       " Thank you. Congressman Lynch for the question. It’s a very important question. First I would simply start by saying, I think FinCEN has done an excellent job at looking at the issues of money laundering, terrorist financing in the context of virtual assets, virtual currencies. They led the way as the first federal regulator, to in fact put in place rules around that back in 2013, that led firms like Circle, Coinbase and many others here to put in place licensing supervision around bank secrecy act, anti-money laundering provisions, and the like.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Mr. Olair: (<a data-wpel-link=\"exclude\" href=\"https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/FK4Sq9VozH4P5INV5eY8CoFR8T8IV1XBcC-elHVPodGKjdFPoGQhFRcOwBl1KkT2rJ2blSBNC-MIPAj12LvByFVR_gA?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=12416.89\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">03:26:56</a>)<br/>\n",
       " I think the specific issue at hand, which you are correct, we had some significant objections to was really two-fold. One was there was a introduction of an 11th hour rule making that did not have a significant public comment. And I think at the bottom of that issue is there are some really significant things about the way digital assets and blockchains work that we want to make sure if we’re going to be introducing rules around reporting, that they take account of the unique things with public blockchain infrastructures in particular. Notably, public blockchain infrastructures are in some ways like the public internet or the worldwide web or email. They’re open networks that anyone can connect to join and use.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Mr. Olair: (<a data-wpel-link=\"exclude\" href=\"https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/FK4Sq9VozH4P5INV5eY8CoFR8T8IV1XBcC-elHVPodGKjdFPoGQhFRcOwBl1KkT2rJ2blSBNC-MIPAj12LvByFVR_gA?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=12467.45\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">03:27:47</a>)<br/>\n",
       " And it’s one of the really powerful things that has made information exchange free. And I think it’s one of the things that we believe with digital assets on blockchains can make value exchange much more frictionless for people around the world. And then part of that is that there are the ability for an individual to self-custody assets with a piece of hardware or piece of software. That piece of software could be downloaded from an app store. And they’re self-custodying a stablecoin like USDC or a Bitcoin. And the software maker itself is not involved in facilitating a customer transaction. They’re really just a software developer providing technology that end users can use. And I think the rule as it was outlined would kind of be a square peg-round hole or a bit of a blunt force instrument.</p>,\n",

       " And what we argued, and I think is hopefully going to bear fruit significantly over the next year, is that what we really need are ways to provide proof of digital identities. A firm like Circle or a firm like FTX or Coinbase or Paxos or other folks testifying here could provide a cryptographic proof that someone has been KYC-ed, and that proof could actually be carried around with them in a hardware wallet or a software wallet. And then you’d have the ability to know that you’ve got legitimate actors to be able to have the right information about users without having essentially more PII or personal identifiable information being broadcasted really broadly. And so I think our view was give the industry more time to develop technology that can allow these forms of transactions to happen, but still preserve privacy and take advantage of the really significant security benefits that come from cryptography.</p>,\n",

I think the easiest way to understand it is let’s contrast blockchain transactions with normal banking transactions to see how much easier it is to trace them on a blockchain than it is in a banking transaction. So let’s imagine for a moment that… I would never do this because this would be flagrantly illegal, but let’s say I bought you lunch. Okay? And let’s say that afterwards you wanted to Venmo me your payment back, right? So you hit your Venmo button on your iPhone and you sent me money.

       " So all Venmo does is send an instruction to your bank. Your bank then receives that instruction, they write it down in their books and records, and then they then send an instruction to an underlying transfer network. It could be the automated clearing house, it could be the Fedwire system or something else. That system then contacts my bank. It inquires whether my bank has enough money to pay you. Once that’s been done, then there’s a debit from my account. It’s very complicated. And in any one of those steps, information could be lost. There could be a breach, something bad could happen.</p>,\n",

       " Versus in a blockchain, there are no intermediaries. I’m not sending instructions to a third party to send instructions to another third party, to eventually send you money. I’ve sent you money. And when the block is validated, I can see that my wallet address transferred that value to your wallet address, simple as that. The easiest way for people to understand how easy this is, because we’ve had a lot of talk of hacking and cyber security issues, the reason that we found the bad guys in the Colonial Pipeline hack, was because they asked for Bitcoin. If they had asked for diamonds, if they had asked for cash, if they’d asked for almost any other thing, we’d never have caught the bad guys.

In 2008, we saw the dangers of instability in fraud money market funds, and now rating agencies are saying that.

       " Thank you for the question. I think this is a crucial topic when it comes to stablecoins. I think the key point here is to define stablecoin.

If a stable coin is backed by only cash equivalents, essentially money that’s sitting in an FDIC insured bank account, or sitting in T-Bills that mature in three months, there is no risk of a run. It’s liquid cash. You’ve taken simply a dollar and you’ve tokenized it. And there’s very good uses for that, and there’s really good reasons to set it up that way.</p>,\n",

Earlier today in the hearing, Representative Velasquez asked about proprietary trading on the Coinbase platform. And in that moment, I believe you had told her quote that, “Coinbase does not engage in proprietary trading on our platform. All prices are established,” et cetera. However, in looking at the Coinbase rules under section 3.21 under Coinbase corporate ops, it says, “Coinbase Inc, which owns and operates Coinbase Pro and Exchange also its own corporate funds on Coinbase Pro and Exchange.” And I just wanted to give you briefly the opportunity to clarify.</p>,\n",

One contention is that the vibe of crypto is a stick it to the man vibe, but in actuality, it’s dominated and controlled by big tech and Wall Street. While the culture may be somewhat accurately described, the notion that a handful of big tech leaders and Wall Street banks somehow created and now control crypto is absurd on its face.

The rest of it we can come to. But in terms of the problems being solved, I think the first issue is the biggest critics of cryptocurrency have been the biggest banks. Those are the people who are the most concerned about the entry of stablecoins into the payment system, about the ability of crypto assets to build networks that are away from the clearinghouse.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies do that without human beings and with no fee and the elimination of minimum account balance fees, the $25 wire transfer fee that your bank charges to give you three days to send money.

       " Thank you, Madam chair. And thank you so much for everyone that have been coming forward in regards to this important issue. Cryptocurrency like Bitcoin currently consumes enough energy to power a small nation, and that’s something that continues to be missed in this debate around this issue. The University of Cambridge analysis estimated that Bitcoin mining consumes 121 terawatt-hours a year. To put that in perspective for everyone, that’s more electricity than the entire country Argentina consumes. That’s more than consumption of Google, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft combined. One Bitcoin transaction, a single purchase sale, or transfer uses the same amount of electricity as the typical US household uses in more than a month. So this is really outstanding to me and many folks do not know this, many Americans and folks that are talking about this issue. So Ms. Dixon, can you explain why for cryptocurrency like Bitcoin that rely on proof of work model mining is such an energy intensive process?</p>,\n",

       " Thank you for the question. This is a really important area, obviously in terms of sustainability and the focus on what we do in this space. We should always be trying to do it better and much more efficiently. In Bitcoin, the way that Bitcoin consensus is achieved is through really complicated math equations. So there’s a lot of energy that’s needed to be used to be able to make that happen. I know best about the consensus mechanism on seller, which is the Stellar Consensus Protocol, which can be done on a very small computer, any of the ones that you have in front of you. University of [Lund 03:59:21] did a study on the Stellar network itself, and the network is low in terms of energy consumption. It’s around 0.00022 kilowatts per hour for each transaction. That’s less than a transaction for Visa.</p>,\n",

Again, there are many different ones out there and depending on the mechanism, it depends on the energy consumption.

Particularly alarmed that previously idled shut down coal plants like the one operated by Greenwich generation in Seneca Falls, New York are now being brought back online to aid in cryptocurrency mining. I don’t know if the chairwoman knows this, but like in Montana, a coal fire generating station is now providing a hundred percent of its energy to Marathon Digital Holdings for Bitcoin mining under Power Purchase Agreement. Prior to the crackdown in China, it was estimated that nearly two thirds of all Bitcoin mining took place in China, included in regions with very heavy power generation sets in Mongolia and other areas. But Ms. Dixon, should the world central banks and governments be taking a more active role in monitoring and regulating cryptocurrency in order to bring energy consumption and carbon emissions in line with our own targets here in our country at the Paris Agreement.

So we constantly have to be doing that kind of analysis. I think that we all need to focus on minimizing the energy consumption as much as possible, and then think about how we can work with governments to be able to consider the best way to achieve the carbon neutral status that I think a lot of folks want us to get to.

What I remember about this room is it was a full city block long and if you stood at the end of the room and looked at that chart, it was a straight line up and to the right.

And when you think about NFTs in an NFT marketplace, when you think about Bitcoin itself, when you think about these new protocols where all you’re doing is getting a right to governance in a protocol, they do not fit under the contours of existing frameworks and neat definitions.</p>,\n",

       " Yes. Thank you. Paxos was the first company in the entire country to become regulated. We operate using a trust company status. And the reason we do that is because we don’t make loans and take deposits. So a trust company is actually safer than a bank. So that’s an example of using a state regulatory authority in order to oversee our business. I think having either our primary regulator that’s on the state basis or on a federal basis is what will allow there to be a consistent application of AML KYC rules, reserve rules, customer protection rules. So there isn’t a clear way to be able to do that right now. We feel this even ourselves as a trust company where we don’t have explicit reciprocity in a state by state basis.

The topic we talk a lot about also in this committee and an issue front of mind for many underserved communities around the United States.

       " I love that question, and thank you for giving me a chance to address it. Couple of things. So first of all, let’s ask, why do we have so many underbanked people in the United States? And the answer is a combination of minimum balance fees, monthly account maintenance fees, and all kinds of other things that are a hallmark of the money center model that banking is built on. Right? If you talk to Mr. Allaire about his product, he would tell you they don’t have any minimum balance fees. They don’t have any monthly maintenance fees. You can keep your assets in a tokenized bank deposit for free. So that’s the first answer is there are no $10 a month fees. There are no $25 wire charges. Those things don’t exist that eat away at your life savings. A.</p>,\n",

       " And B, the next most important thing about crypto is here you have an early stage asset, which unlike the IPO boom, unlike venture capital, doesn’t require that you know a guy or that you be well connected or that you be an accredited investor to participate. This is a chance for underrepresented communities to be in on the wealth creation stage of some new thing as opposed to coming in at the end. So what I always say is that’s the way you solve under representation is through wealth creation. This is an opportunity, and that is why there are more minority investors than white investors in crypto in the United States is because of this.</p>,\n",

And when you look at the developing world, it’s access to financial services that is a real problem. I think in significant ways, they want access to U.S. dollars, but they also want access to crypto. They want to have the ability to protect themselves when they’re in either politically unstable environments or economically unstable environments, or both.

A lot of younger people have grown up with the internet. They were born with the internet in their crib, so to speak, and I think have an expectation of value being able to be used the same way that they can share a JPEG photo or react to something. And so I think there’s just a familiarity and an expectation that, of course, everything’s going to be digital. And so I think the expectations are different. I think that a component of digital asset markets is this concept of democratizing access to financial markets, and digital asset markets do that. There is more democratized access. There are fewer barriers to entry for individuals and I think that affects the adoption rates in minority communities. It affects adoption rates more generally on some of those other demographics.

The current regime of regulation by enforcement in which entrepreneurs must negotiate with the SEC or the CFTC on a one off basis is not fair, it’s not efficient, or conducive to U.S. based innovation. Congress needs to provide clarity and predictability by statute and I’m ready to work with both my Democratic and my Republican colleagues to provide that. The rules of the road for Web Three can be a bipartisan initiative. The United States needs a primary crypto regulator that is tech and market structure neutral and that has three imperatives, it compels disclosure and transparency, it prevents fraud and abuse, and it promotes the efficiency and the resilience of the market. And this primary regulator should work with a self-regulatory organization as a counterpart in the private sector to establish one light touch rule book for spot and derivatives listings, custody requirements, token issuance, asset servicing, cross margining settlement, know your customer and anti-money laundering, disclosure and auditing, and, of course, stable coding standards.</p>,\n",

It’s not clear exactly how you can trust a dollar stablecoin, and that’s unfortunate. Money is ultimately a product and the way money is working today for people leaves a lot to be desired. Being able to put a dollar into a blockchain environment solves so many problems that we’ve been talking about all day to day here. And I think that it’s crucial for us to be able to set a clear regulatory plan in place that creates parity across all of these different products. And so I think it’s really simple. If you have a primary regulator, you have clear reserves, you have made sure that you back them by cash, cash equivalence, that creates very much a level playing field for all different dollar back stablecoins.

       " Thank you, Madam Chair, appreciate this hearing. Ms. Dixon, a question for you. As you know, my home state of Texas earlier this year created a more friendlier jurisdiction for crypto and blockchain in an effort to be a leader in that space. And I saw that MoneyGram, which has many employees in my district and is headquartered right outside of my district, you’ve developed a partnership with them. And I was just wondering if you could go into further detail what doing with MoneyGram. And then, for those that don’t know, MoneyGram is one of the premier money transfer operations in the world. There are countries that literally 20% of their GDP is transferred in by MoneyGram. So it’s a pretty important product for a lot of the world. I was wondering if you could talk about what you’re doing with them.</p>,\n",

       " Yeah. I think that’s why it’s such an important part. Thank you so much for the question. It demonstrates not just the interoperability that blockchain has with the existing financial infrastructure, but it also demonstrates that you can actually offer services to traditionally unbanked or underbanked folks all over the world leveraging this kind of technology. And, finally, I think importantly from the MoneyGram standpoint and from [Remitter’s 04:36:32] standpoint, actually, it provides instantaneous settlement. So they don’t have IOU’s out there. They actually have the money in their bank account when they’re using the stablecoins, which is very important for us to be able to get right. So the MoneyGram relationship, which is in pilot right now in the United States, allows folks, you don’t need to have a bank account to be able to get assets put on the blockchain. Right now, the hardest part about blockchain is the on and off ramp.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Ms. Dixon: (<a data-wpel-link=\"exclude\" href=\"https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/FK4Sq9VozH4P5INV5eY8CoFR8T8IV1XBcC-elHVPodGKjdFPoGQhFRcOwBl1KkT2rJ2blSBNC-MIPAj12LvByFVR_gA?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=16617.41\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">04:36:57</a>)<br/>\n",
       " We actually haven’t done that exceptionally well because, unless you have a bank account, it’s very, very hard to be able to get money into digital assets. The MoneyGram relationship could be one of many that actually demonstrates the ease of use that you can have. The beautiful thing about this is that MoneyGram, who acted very quickly, in less than two months was able to help to develop this technology and this integration with Stellar. There’s one part of it, but the other part of it is, all you have to have is a wallet that’s Stellar enabled. So, a wallet anywhere in the world. It doesn’t have to be a specific wallet to be able to then walk into MoneyGram, get assets onto the blockchain using your fiat, your local fiat. It’ll convert into USDC, which is Mr. Alair’s coin, and then you could have that in your wallet, you can generate yield on that, you can do lots of other things with respect to the assets that you have.</p>,\n",

       " You could then send them to family in a different country, for example. And once this is global, which will be next year, you could then go into participating MoneyGram locations and have those assets converted into your local currency, which is very important. So it works very well with the cash economy and cash ecosystems, and it demonstrates the true interoperability with blockchain and traditional financial infrastructure, because that’s what MoneyGram is and has done exceptionally well. And it demonstrates the value that these traditional players bring because they’ve created this really important ecosystem and network of folks all over the world that have feet on the ground that really work with cash, the individuals that have cash, to be able to deliver value to them. Whether that be to be able to get it from family outside of their country or just to be able to convert these into digital assets. So it’s a really exciting and transformational opportunity, in my opinion, for blockchain because of the speed of use and the ease at which you can get money on and off the blockchain.</p>,\n",
